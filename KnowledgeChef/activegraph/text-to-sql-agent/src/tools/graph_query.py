"""Reference tool: graph_query. CONTRACT v0.7 #16.

`graph_query` is a tool whose body operates on the graph itself —
the demonstration that the tool primitive is general, not just an
"external API" escape hatch. It goes through the same event-sourced
invocation path as any other tool: `tool.requested` / `tool.responded`
events, the same cache, the same budget.

Per CONTRACT v0.7 #5, the `ToolContext` deliberately does NOT carry
a graph reference — tools that need the graph close over it via a
factory at registration time. `make_graph_query_tool(graph)` returns
a Tool bound to the supplied graph.

Per CONTRACT v0.7 #7 (tool-determinism decision), `graph_query` is
marked `deterministic=True`: given the same graph state, it returns
the same answer. But replay still serves from cache by default; the
`Runtime(replay_reinvoke_deterministic=True)` opt-in is what lets
deterministic tools actually re-invoke during replay. Reasoning:
even a deterministic tool's correctness depends on the reconstructed
graph state matching the recorded state at the moment of the call,
and that's a strong invariant — cheaper and more honest to serve
from cache.
