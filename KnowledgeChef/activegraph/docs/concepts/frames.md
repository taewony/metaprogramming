# Frames

A frame is a bounded context for behavior dispatch. Events carry a
`frame_id`; behaviors can filter their subscription by
`frame_id`; a run can contain multiple frames running in parallel
without their behaviors crossing wires.

Frames are an optional primitive. Most uses of the framework don't
need them — a single-frame run is the default and covers every
example in the quickstart, the diligence pack, and the cookbook
patterns. **If you're not sure whether you need frames, you
probably don't.** Use them when you need to scope behavior
dispatch beyond a single event-type filter.

## What frames are for

Three use cases where frames earn their weight:

- **Multi-tenant graph state.** One runtime, many tenants. Each
  tenant gets a frame; behaviors filter by `frame_id` to keep
  tenant A's events from triggering work on tenant B's data.
  Without frames, the same separation would require either a
  per-tenant runtime (heavy) or `where=` filters on every
  behavior (error-prone).
- **Parallel hypothesis exploration before fork is appropriate.**
  When the framework is reasoning about multiple hypotheses
  simultaneously and you want each to be a distinct context but
  don't yet want the fork primitive's cost (a fork is a separate
  run; frames are sub-contexts within one run). Useful for
  short-lived parallel reasoning that converges back to a single
  output.
- **Structured conversations.** When a long-running goal has
  multiple distinct sub-tasks, each with its own behavior
  dispatch logic, frames are the bounded-context primitive for
  the sub-task. Each sub-task's events stay in its own frame; the
  sub-task's behaviors filter on the frame_id.

## How frames scope dispatch

A behavior with `frame_id="..."` in its `where=` clause fires
only on events from that frame:

```python
@behavior(
    on=["object.created"],
    where={"frame_id": "tenant_a"},
)
def tenant_a_only(event, graph, ctx):
    ...
```

Without the filter, the behavior fires on events from every
frame in the run. The runtime doesn't auto-scope behaviors by
frame — the explicit filter is the contract.

Frame ids are strings, framework- or developer-generated.
Framework-generated frames use the same monotonic id pattern as
events; developer-generated frames can use semantically-meaningful
names (`tenant_a`, `hypothesis_left`, `sub_task_42`).

## Relationship to runs

A run is the framework's top-level unit (one event log, one store
binding). A frame is a sub-context within a run.

- **One run, one frame** — the default. Every event in the run
  belongs to the same frame; behaviors don't need to filter by
  `frame_id`.
- **One run, many frames** — the use cases above. Events from
  different frames coexist in the same event log; behaviors that
  care about isolation filter explicitly.
- **Many runs, many frames** — also valid; each run's frames are
  independent. Common when multi-tenant systems shard tenants
  across multiple runs and also frame within each.

Frames don't cross runs. A frame is run-scoped — moving a frame
between runs would mean copying events, which is what fork and
migrate are for.

## Frames vs forks

Both let parallel computations proceed in isolation. The
difference is durability and replay:

- **Fork** is a separate run with shared event-log lineage up to
  the fork point. Forks are durable and replayable
  independently. Use fork when the parallel branches might
  diverge permanently or need independent persistence.
- **Frames** are sub-contexts within one run. The frame's events
  live in the same event log as everything else; replay is the
  whole run. Use frames when the parallel contexts are
  short-lived or semantically belong together.

A common pattern is to start parallel work in frames and fork
only the branches that prove worth keeping. See
[`forking`](forking.md) for the fork primitive.

## What's related

- [`behaviors`](behaviors.md) — where `frame_id` filters appear
  in `where=`.
- [`events`](events.md) — events carry `frame_id`; the field is
  in the event structure.
- [`forking`](forking.md) — the durable parallel-context
  primitive; complements frames.
- [`replay`](replay.md) — frames replay as part of their run;
  there's no per-frame replay primitive.
