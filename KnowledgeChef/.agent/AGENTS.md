# Agent Infrastructure

This folder is the portable brain. Any harness (Claude Code,
Cursor, Windsurf, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Copilot CLI, Gemini, Hermes, Pi, Codex, standalone Python,
Antigravity) can mount it and get the same memory, skills, and protocols.

## Memory (read in this order)
- `memory/personal/PREFERENCES.md` — stable user conventions
- `memory/working/WORKSPACE.md` — current task state
- `memory/working/REVIEW_QUEUE.md` — pending candidate lessons waiting for you
- `memory/semantic/DECISIONS.md` — past architectural choices
- `memory/semantic/LESSONS.md` — distilled patterns (rendered from `lessons.jsonl`)
- `memory/episodic/AGENT_LEARNINGS.jsonl` — raw experience log (top-k by salience)

## Review Queue (host-agent responsibility)

Candidate lessons are clustered + staged automatically by `memory/auto_dream.py`.
The host agent — you — does the actual review using the CLI tools below.

Check `memory/working/REVIEW_QUEUE.md` at session start. If pending > 10 or
oldest staged > 7 days, review before substantive work.

Workflow:
1. `python .agent/tools/list_candidates.py` — pending candidates, sorted by priority
2. For each: decide accept / reject / defer based on claim, evidence_ids,
   cluster_size, and any contradictions with existing LESSONS.md
3. `python .agent/tools/graduate.py <id> --rationale "..."` to accept
4. `python .agent/tools/reject.py <id> --reason "..."` to reject
5. `python .agent/tools/reopen.py <id>` to requeue a previously-rejected item
6. Review in a **batch**, not one-by-one — cross-candidate contradictions
   only surface when you see multiple at once.

The heuristic prefilter in `memory/validate.py` has already dropped obvious
junk (too-short claims, exact duplicates). Everything staged needs real
judgment. Rationale is required for graduation — rubber-stamped promotions
are the exact failure mode this layer prevents.

## Skills
- `skills/_index.md` — read first for discovery
- `skills/_manifest.jsonl` — machine-readable skill metadata
- Load a full `SKILL.md` only when its triggers match the current task
- Every skill has a self-rewrite hook; invoke it after failures

## Design Systems
- If the project root contains `DESIGN.md`, treat it as the source of truth
  for visual design decisions and load `skills/design-md/SKILL.md` when a
  task mentions `DESIGN.md`, Google Stitch, design tokens, design system,
  or visual design. (The skill's `preconditions` field gates loading on
  `DESIGN.md` actually existing — keep this rule in lockstep with
  `skills/_manifest.jsonl` to avoid same-task / different-harness drift.)
- Prefer exact tokens, component rules, and design rationale from
  `DESIGN.md` over invented colors, typography, spacing, shadows, or motion.
- Do not modify `DESIGN.md` unless the user explicitly asks for a design
  system change; implementation work consumes the contract, it doesn't
  edit it.

## Protocols
- `protocols/permissions.md` — read before any tool call
- `protocols/tool_schemas/` — typed interfaces for external tools
- `protocols/delegation.md` — rules for sub-agent handoff

## Host-agent CLI tools (in `tools/`)
Daily driver, highest-leverage first:
- `recall.py "<intent>"` — surface graduated lessons relevant to what
  you're about to do. **Run before deploy / migration / timestamp / debug /
  refactor work.** This is how lessons cross harnesses.
- `learn.py "<rule>" --rationale "<why>"` — teach the agent a new lesson
  in one shot (stage + graduate + render). For rules you already know.
- `show.py` — one-screen dashboard of brain state: episodes, candidates,
  lessons, failing skills, activity graph.
- `data_layer_export.py` — local cross-harness activity/data-layer export:
  agent events, cron timelines, tokens/cost estimates, categories,
  harness mix, `dashboard.html`, and `daily-report.md`.
- `data_flywheel_export.py` — local export of approved, redacted runs into
  trace records, context cards, eval cases, training-ready JSONL, and
  flywheel metrics. It does not train models or call APIs.
- `list_candidates.py` / `graduate.py` / `reject.py` / `reopen.py` — review
  protocol for patterns the dream cycle has staged.
- `retract_lesson.py <lesson_id> --rationale "..."` — stop an accepted lesson
  from being injected into future recall/context while preserving audit history.
- `brain_bridge.py ask|note|status` — optional bridge to the external Brain
  CLI for git-backed long-term memory shared across harnesses.
- `memory_reflect.py <skill> <action> <outcome>` — log a significant event.

## Rules
1. Check memory before decisions you have been corrected on before.
2. If `REVIEW_QUEUE.md` shows backlog past threshold, handle it before the new task.
3. Log every significant action to `memory/episodic/AGENT_LEARNINGS.jsonl`
   via `.agent/tools/memory_reflect.py`.
4. Update `memory/working/WORKSPACE.md` as you work; archive on completion.
5. Never hand-edit `memory/semantic/LESSONS.md` — it's rendered from
   `lessons.jsonl`. Use `graduate.py` / `reject.py` / `retract_lesson.py`.
6. Follow `protocols/permissions.md`. Blocked means blocked.
7. When a self-rewrite hook fires, propose conservative edits only.
8. The harness is dumb on purpose. Reasoning lives in skills + the host agent.
