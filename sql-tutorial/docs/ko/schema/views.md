# 02. 뷰

## 뷰(View)란?

뷰는 **자주 사용하는 SELECT 쿼리를 이름을 붙여 저장**한 것입니다. 테이블처럼 `SELECT * FROM v_monthly_sales`로 조회할 수 있지만, 데이터를 직접 저장하지는 않습니다. 뷰를 조회할 때마다 내부의 SQL이 실행됩니다.

**뷰를 사용하는 이유:**

- **편의성** — 5개 테이블을 JOIN하는 복잡한 쿼리를 매번 작성하지 않아도 됩니다
- **일관성** — "월별 매출"의 계산 방식이 뷰에 한 번만 정의되므로, 누가 조회해도 같은 결과
- **보안** — 원본 테이블 대신 뷰만 접근 권한을 부여하면, 민감한 칼럼(이메일, 전화번호 등)을 노출하지 않을 수 있습니다
- **추상화** — 테이블 구조가 변경되어도 뷰의 인터페이스를 유지하면 기존 쿼리가 깨지지 않습니다

뷰에 대한 상세 학습은 [22. 뷰(Views)](../advanced/22-views.md) 레슨에서 다룹니다.

!!! info "DB별 뷰 지원"
    18개 뷰는 SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server 모두에서 동일하게 제공됩니다.

    PostgreSQL에서는 `v_monthly_sales`와 `v_product_performance`가 **Materialized View**(`mv_` 접두어)로도 제공됩니다.
    Materialized View는 쿼리 결과를 물리적으로 저장하여 매번 재계산하지 않으므로, 대용량 집계 뷰에서 성능이 크게 향상됩니다.

    | DB | Materialized View | 비고 |
    |----|:-:|------|
    | PostgreSQL | `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` + `REFRESH` | 네이티브 지원 |
    | MySQL | 미지원 | 테이블 + 이벤트 스케줄러로 수동 구현 가능 |
    | SQLite | 미지원 | 트리거 + 별도 테이블로 수동 구현 가능 |
