# Lesson 13: Numeric, Conversion, and Conditional Functions

In [Lesson 12](12-string.md), we learned string functions. Beyond dates and strings, SQL also has math functions for numbers, conversion functions to change data types, and conditional functions to select values based on conditions. Learning all three at once greatly increases the expressiveness of your queries.

!!! note "Already familiar?"
    If you're comfortable with ROUND, ABS, CAST, NULLIF, and GREATEST/LEAST, skip ahead to [Lesson 14: UNION](14-union.md).

## Math Functions

### ROUND -- Rounding

`ROUND(value, digits)` rounds to the specified number of decimal places. We used it briefly in Lesson 4, but here we cover it systematically.

```sql
-- Average price at various decimal places
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(price), 2)  AS avg_2dp,
    ROUND(AVG(price), 0)  AS avg_int,
    ROUND(AVG(price), -3) AS avg_1000
FROM products
WHERE is_active = 1;
```

**Result (example):**

| avg_2dp | avg_int | avg_1000 |
| ----------: | ----------: | ----------: |
| 659594.5 | 659594.0 | 659594.0 |

> `ROUND(value, -3)` rounds to the nearest thousand. Useful when displaying approximate values in reports.

### ABS -- Absolute Value

```sql
-- Difference between cost and selling price (prevent negatives)
SELECT
    name,
    price,
    cost_price,
    ABS(price - cost_price) AS margin
FROM products
WHERE is_active = 1
ORDER BY margin DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### CEIL / FLOOR -- Ceiling and Floor

=== "SQLite"
    SQLite does not have `CEIL`/`FLOOR`. Use `CAST` and `CASE` as substitutes.

    ```sql
    -- Ceiling: round up shipping cost to nearest 1000
    SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN total_amount % 1000 = 0
                THEN total_amount / 1000
            ELSE total_amount / 1000 + 1
        END AS shipping_units
    FROM orders
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

=== "MySQL"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        CEIL(4.2)  AS ceil_val,   -- 5
        FLOOR(4.8) AS floor_val;  -- 4

    -- Round up shipping cost to nearest 1000
    SELECT
        total_amount,
        CEIL(total_amount / 1000.0) * 1000 AS rounded_up
    FROM orders
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

=== "PostgreSQL"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        CEIL(4.2)  AS ceil_val,   -- 5
        FLOOR(4.8) AS floor_val;  -- 4

    -- Round up shipping cost to nearest 1000
    SELECT
        total_amount,
        CEIL(total_amount / 1000.0) * 1000 AS rounded_up
    FROM orders
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

### MOD -- Remainder

```sql
-- Extract even-ID customers only (A/B test group splitting)
SELECT id, name, grade
FROM customers
WHERE MOD(id, 2) = 0
  AND is_active = 1
LIMIT 10;
```

> In SQLite, use the `a % b` operator instead of `MOD(a, b)`.

### RANDOM -- Random Sampling

=== "SQLite"
    ```sql
    -- Extract 5 random products
    SELECT name, price
    FROM products
    WHERE is_active = 1
    ORDER BY RANDOM()
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

=== "MySQL"
    ```sql
    -- Extract 5 random products
    SELECT name, price
    FROM products
    WHERE is_active = 1
    ORDER BY RAND()
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

=== "PostgreSQL"
    ```sql
    -- Extract 5 random products
    SELECT name, price
    FROM products
    WHERE is_active = 1
    ORDER BY RANDOM()
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

> **Warning:** `ORDER BY RANDOM()` sorts all rows, so it's slow on large tables. Use alternative sampling techniques in production.

## Type Conversion Functions

### CAST -- Type Conversion

`CAST(expression AS type)` explicitly converts data types. We already used `CAST(SUBSTR(...) AS INTEGER)` in Lesson 12.

```sql
-- String -> Number
SELECT CAST('12345' AS INTEGER) AS num_val;

-- Number -> String (for concatenation)
SELECT 'Order #' || CAST(id AS TEXT) AS label
FROM orders
LIMIT 3;
```

=== "SQLite"
    ```sql
    -- SQLite types: INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB, NUMERIC
    SELECT
        CAST(price AS INTEGER) AS int_price,
        CAST(id AS TEXT)       AS text_id,
        TYPEOF(price)          AS price_type
    FROM products
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

    > `TYPEOF(expr)` is a SQLite-specific function that returns the actual storage type of a value.

=== "MySQL"
    ```sql
    -- MySQL conversion types: SIGNED, UNSIGNED, CHAR, DATE, DECIMAL, etc.
    SELECT
        CAST(price AS SIGNED)       AS int_price,
        CAST(id AS CHAR)            AS text_id,
        CAST('2024-03-15' AS DATE)  AS date_val
    FROM products
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

=== "PostgreSQL"
    ```sql
    -- PostgreSQL also supports :: shorthand syntax
    SELECT
        price::integer    AS int_price,
        id::text          AS text_id,
        '2024-03-15'::date AS date_val
    FROM products
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

### Integer Division Pitfall

We covered this in Lesson 4, but it's the most common conversion mistake, so it's worth emphasizing again.

```sql
-- Integer / Integer = Integer (decimals truncated!)
SELECT 7 / 2 AS wrong;    -- 3 (not 3.5!)

-- Solution: Convert one side to float
SELECT 7 / 2.0 AS correct;           -- 3.5
SELECT CAST(7 AS REAL) / 2 AS also;  -- 3.5
SELECT 7 * 1.0 / 2 AS trick;         -- 3.5
```

```sql
-- Practical: Cancellation rate vs total orders
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'cancelled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cancelled,
    ROUND(
        SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'cancelled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*),
        1
    ) AS cancel_rate_pct
FROM orders;
```

## Conditional Functions

### NULLIF -- Preventing Division by Zero

`NULLIF(a, b)` -- returns NULL if a equals b, otherwise returns a. Most commonly used to prevent division-by-zero errors.

```sql
-- Prevent division by zero
SELECT
    category_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_active = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS active_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_active = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS inactive_count,
    ROUND(
        SUM(CASE WHEN is_active = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0
        / NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN is_active = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0),
        1
    ) AS active_to_inactive_ratio
FROM products
GROUP BY category_id
LIMIT 5;
```

> `NULLIF(denominator, 0)` -- if the denominator is 0, returns NULL so you get NULL instead of an error.

### IIF / IF -- Simple Conditional Branching

A shorthand for CASE expressions. Can be written concisely when there is only one condition.

=== "SQLite"
    ```sql
    -- IIF(condition, true_value, false_value) — SQLite 3.32.0+
    SELECT
        name,
        price,
        IIF(price >= 1000000, '고가', '일반') AS price_tier
    FROM products
    WHERE is_active = 1
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

=== "MySQL"
    ```sql
    -- IF(condition, true_value, false_value)
    SELECT
        name,
        price,
        IF(price >= 1000000, '고가', '일반') AS price_tier
    FROM products
    WHERE is_active = 1
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

=== "PostgreSQL"
    ```sql
    -- PostgreSQL has no IIF/IF -> use CASE
    SELECT
        name,
        price,
        CASE WHEN price >= 1000000 THEN '고가' ELSE '일반' END AS price_tier
    FROM products
    WHERE is_active = 1
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

### GREATEST / LEAST -- Max/Min Among Multiple Values

Used to compare values across multiple columns within a row. `MAX`/`MIN` aggregate across rows, while `GREATEST`/`LEAST` compare across columns.

=== "SQLite"
    SQLite does not have `GREATEST`/`LEAST`. `MAX()`/`MIN()` serve the same purpose.

    ```sql
    -- Greater of order amount and 1,000,000 (guaranteed minimum)
    SELECT
        order_number,
        total_amount,
        MAX(total_amount, 1000000) AS guaranteed_min
    FROM orders
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

=== "MySQL"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        order_number,
        total_amount,
        GREATEST(total_amount, 1000000) AS guaranteed_min,
        LEAST(total_amount, 5000000)    AS capped_max
    FROM orders
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

=== "PostgreSQL"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        order_number,
        total_amount,
        GREATEST(total_amount, 1000000) AS guaranteed_min,
        LEAST(total_amount, 5000000)    AS capped_max
    FROM orders
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

> **MAX vs GREATEST:** `MAX(col)` finds the maximum across multiple **rows**, while `GREATEST(a, b, c)` finds the maximum among multiple **values** within a single **row**.
