## About the Author

**Youngje Ahn** (civilian7@gmail.com) · **Fullbit Computing** · **CEO**

I first encountered programming in 1983 with an 8-bit computer and BASIC, and have been a professional programmer since 1989. Over the years, I've worked across finance, government, healthcare, IoT, and real estate, building programs in many languages. Among them, Delphi has been my primary language for over 30 years, starting from version 1.0. I run the Delphi community [Delmadang](https://cafe.naver.com/delmadang).

Online, I go by **"Country Programmer"** — a name I adopted while living in the countryside of Hongcheon, Gangwon Province. After encountering AI, the creative drive I had in my twenties came rushing back, and I moved back to the city. I currently run Fullbit Computing in Hanam, Gyeonggi Province, developing a universal query browser called **ezQuery**.

For feature suggestions, bug reports, or inquiries, please contact [civilian7@gmail.com](mailto:civilian7@gmail.com).

!!! note "What is ezQuery?"
    **ezQuery** is a universal query browser that manages multiple databases — SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Tibero, and more — through a single interface. Built with Delphi, it uses **DirectX (Direct2D)** rendering to smoothly display large datasets.

    - **Fast** — Native binary + DirectX rendering for instant scrolling through hundreds of thousands of rows
    - **Keyboard-friendly** — Monaco editor-based SQL editor with shortcut-driven workflow
    - **AI Assistant** — AI that automatically recognizes schema context for SQL generation, error correction, and execution plan analysis
    - **All-in-one** — Table designer, ERD viewer, visual query builder, data import/export
    - **Multi-DB** — Designed from the ground up with a DB abstraction layer, making it easy to add new databases
    - **Multilingual** — Supports Korean and English by default, with architecture designed for easy addition of other languages

    We plan to include this tutorial's database as a sample. The product is currently in development, and we'll announce it separately upon release. We plan to offer a free **Community Edition** and a paid **Pro Edition** with advanced features.

## Why I Created This Tutorial

It started while creating a sample database for **ezQuery**. As I worked on it, I recalled the frustrations of my junior days — **wanting to learn SQL but having nowhere to practice with real data**. So I expanded it beyond a simple sample into a proper tutorial, and I'm sharing it in hopes of helping anyone with the same struggle.

## Collaboration with AI

This tutorial was created in collaboration with **[Claude](https://claude.ai)** (Anthropic). From the data model, generator code, lessons, exercises, DB-specific DDL/views/stored procedures, to this document itself — every step involved working with AI.

However, we didn't simply use AI-generated output as-is. At each stage, roles were clearly divided:

| Stage | Human | AI |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Ideas | Direction setting, requirements definition | Structure proposals, initial drafts |
| Code | Review/revision, execution/debugging | Code generation, DB syntax conversion |
| Data | Business logic validation | Bulk data generation/conversion |
| Documentation | Wrote the first lesson directly (baseline) | Pattern learning, then expanding the rest |
| Verification | Final judgment | Automated checking of number mismatches, broken links, DDL differences |

We repeated this cycle hundreds of times to improve quality.

    Direction setting + Structure proposals"] --> B["⌨️ Code
    Review/revision + Generation/conversion"]
    B --> C["🗄️ Data Generation
    Logic validation + Bulk generation"]
    C --> D["📝 Documentation
    Baseline writing + Pattern expansion"]
    D --> E["✅ Verification
    Final judgment + Automated checks"]
    E -->|"Design change"| A
    E -->|"Code fix"| B
    E -->|"Data correction"| C
    E -->|"Doc revision"| D
```

The human focuses on **"Is this correct?"** while the AI handles **"fast and at scale."** Thanks to this combination, work that would have taken months alone was completed in a much shorter time.

## Why Python?

My primary languages are Delphi and C/C++, but the data generator is written in Python.

- **Faker library** — The only option for generating realistic fake data (Korean names, addresses, phone numbers) by locale
- **Minimal barrier to entry** — Readers are here to learn SQL. They may not know Delphi and have no reason to purchase a commercial license. With Python, anyone can start with a single `pip install`
- **Cross-platform** — Works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **AI collaboration efficiency** — Python is the language AI handles best. Collaboration speed is maximized at every stage: code generation, refactoring, and debugging

The right tool for the right job. For a one-time task like data generation, Python — with its rich ecosystem and high accessibility — was the optimal choice.

## Why This Tutorial?

SQL is hard to learn from books alone. Memorizing syntax doesn't enable you to write queries, and 10-row samples don't build real-world intuition. This tutorial is a **"learn by querying"** resource.

**Realistic data** — 750K rows of data from a growing online store over 10 years includes sales growth trends, year-end peaks, customer churn, NULLs, and outliers. Not textbook-clean data, but the real thing you encounter in practice.

**Five databases at once** — Solve the same problems in SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. Compare DB-specific syntax with a single tab switch, building SQL skills that aren't tied to any particular database.

**Data you build yourself** — A seed-based generator is included, letting you freely adjust data size, language, and noise. You can use the tutorial's data as-is or create your own.

| Traditional Resources | This Tutorial |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Syntax explanations only, no practice data | **750K rows** with 10-year growth curves, seasonality, and customer behavior |
| Covers only one DB | **SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server** — same problems across five DBs |
| Answers only | Full answers + explanations + result tables for all **910 problems** |
| Fixed data, no customization | **Seed-based generator** — freely adjust size, language, and noise |
| Grammar-listing format | Practice centered on shopping mall **business scenarios** |
| English or Korean only | Both data and documentation in **Korean/English** |

## Supported Databases { #supported-databases }

This tutorial supports five databases. Each has different characteristics — choose based on your needs, or try multiple DBs.

### SQLite

A single file is the database. No server installation needed — you can use it immediately with just the Python standard library, no `pip install` required. This is the default DB for this tutorial.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| No installation needed, deploy by copying a file | Limited concurrent writes (single writer) |
| Lightweight and fast (embedded) | No user management or access control |
| Supports most of the SQL standard | No stored procedure support |
| Embedded in mobile and desktop apps | Not suitable for large-scale concurrent access |

### MySQL / MariaDB

The world's most widely used open-source RDBMS. It's the standard for web services, and MariaDB is a compatible fork of MySQL. The MySQL SQL in this tutorial runs as-is on MariaDB.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Rich ecosystem, hosting support | Some SQL standard non-compliance (FULL OUTER JOIN, etc.) |
| Excellent read performance, easy replication | Subquery optimization weaker than PG |
| Convenience features like ENUM, AUTO_INCREMENT | CHECK constraints only enforced from 8.0.16+ |
| Cloud support: AWS RDS, Cloud SQL, etc. | Window functions only from 8.0+ |

### PostgreSQL

The open-source RDBMS with the highest standards compliance. It excels in complex queries, JSON processing, and extensibility, and is especially popular in data analytics and geospatial (PostGIS) domains.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Highest SQL standard compliance | May be slightly slower than MySQL for simple reads |
| Rich types: JSONB, arrays, range types | Configuration somewhat complex for beginners |
| Native Materialized Views, partitioning | Default replication setup more complex than MySQL |
| PL/pgSQL, custom types, extension modules | Less web hosting support than MySQL |

### Oracle

The #1 commercial RDBMS in the enterprise market. Excels in large-scale transaction processing and high availability, widely used in finance, government, and enterprise systems.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Enterprise-grade stability and performance | High commercial license costs |
| Powerful server-side logic with PL/SQL | Syntax differs significantly from other DBs |
| Advanced features: partitioning, RAC, Data Guard | Complex installation and administration |
| Rich built-in functions (NVL, DECODE, ROWNUM, etc.) | Free edition (XE) has resource limitations |

### SQL Server

Microsoft's commercial RDBMS, tightly integrated with the .NET ecosystem and Windows environments. Uses T-SQL (Transact-SQL) extended syntax.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Perfect integration with Windows/.NET | Linux support only from 2017 (relatively recent) |
| Powerful SSMS (Management Studio) admin tool | Commercial license costs (Express is free) |
| T-SQL extensions (TOP, ISNULL, CONVERT, etc.) | Some differences from SQL standard syntax |
| Azure SQL cloud integration | Uses TOP/OFFSET FETCH instead of LIMIT |

### Support Scope

| DB | Data Generation | Exercise SQL Tabs | Notes |
|----|:--------------:|:-----------------:|-------|
| SQLite | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | Default DB, single file |
| MySQL | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | DDL + INSERT SQL files, `--apply` supported |
| PostgreSQL | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | DDL + INSERT SQL files, `--apply` supported |
| Oracle | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | PL/SQL, IDENTITY, partitioning, 18 views, 16 SP + 5 functions |
| SQL Server | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | T-SQL, NVARCHAR, partitioning, 18 views, 14 SP |

!!! tip "Oracle / SQL Server Users"
    Use `python -m src.cli.generate --target oracle` or `--target sqlserver` to generate DDL + INSERT + stored procedure SQL files. Exercises also provide Oracle (`NVL`, `FETCH FIRST N ROWS ONLY`, etc.) and SQL Server (`TOP`, `ISNULL`, `CONVERT`, etc.) answer tabs where DB syntax differs.

### Future Support Plans

| Database | Status | Notes |
|----------|:------:|-------|
| DB2 | Under review | Legacy in finance and government |
| CUBRID | Under review | Korean open-source RDBMS |
| Tibero | Under review | Korean commercial RDBMS, Oracle-compatible |

The data generator's architecture separates DB-specific exporters as plugins, so adding a new DB only requires writing DDL/data conversion modules. Contributions are welcome.

## Study Tips

Follow the lessons **in numerical order**. Each lesson builds on what was covered before.

- **Type it yourself** — Typing by hand sticks in memory better than copy-pasting.
- **Always solve the review problems** — Each lesson ends with problems that check the key concepts.
- **Modify the queries** — Change conditions, add columns, or intentionally cause errors. Understanding why the results change is the key.
- **Write the same result in different ways** — Try different approaches using subqueries, JOINs, CTEs, etc. to feel the pros and cons of each syntax.
- **Get in the habit of reading error messages** — SQL error messages usually pinpoint the cause and location precisely. Read the message before searching online.
- **Run on other DBs too** — Running queries learned in SQLite on MySQL and PostgreSQL helps you feel the differences. Use the **DB-specific tabs** in each lesson.
