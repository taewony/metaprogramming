### 1. Second highest selling product ★★★


Find the product with the **second highest total sales** among all products.
Use `DENSE_RANK` because there may be multiple products with the same sales as the product with the highest sales.

> **Presentation Frequency**: ★★★ (Very High) — Amazon, LeetCode #176 variant

| product_name | category | total_revenue | revenue_rank |
|-------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| ... | ... | ... | 2 |


**Hint 1:** - `DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_revenue DESC)`: Ranking where ties are allowed
- Sum up sales by product in CTE → Ranking → `WHERE rank = 2`



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH product_revenue AS (
        SELECT
            p.id,
            p.name AS product_name,
            cat.name AS category,
            SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_revenue
        FROM order_items AS oi
        JOIN orders     AS o   ON oi.order_id   = o.id
        JOIN products   AS p   ON oi.product_id = p.id
        JOIN categories AS cat ON p.category_id = cat.id
        WHERE o.status NOT IN ('cancelled')
        GROUP BY p.id, p.name, cat.name
    ),
    ranked AS (
        SELECT *,
            DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) AS revenue_rank
        FROM product_revenue
    )
    SELECT product_name, category,
           CAST(total_revenue AS INTEGER) AS total_revenue,
           revenue_rank
    FROM ranked
    WHERE revenue_rank = 2;
    ```


    **Result** (1 rows)

    | product_name | category | total_revenue | revenue_rank |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Razer Blade 16 Silver | Gaming Laptop | 907,210,500 | 2 |


---


### 2. Running Total ★★★


Find the **monthly sales** and **year-to-date (YTD)** for 2024.

> **Question frequency**: ★★★ (very high) — Google, Meta frequently appears

| month | monthly_revenue | ytd_revenue |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| 2024-01 | ... | ... |


**Hint 1:** - `SUM(monthly_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month)` = running total
- The basic frame of the window function is `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING ~ CURRENT ROW`



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 7) AS month,
        CAST(SUM(total_amount) AS INTEGER) AS monthly_revenue,
        CAST(SUM(SUM(total_amount)) OVER (ORDER BY SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 7)) AS INTEGER) AS ytd_revenue
    FROM orders
    WHERE ordered_at >= '2024-01-01' AND ordered_at < '2025-01-01'
      AND status NOT IN ('cancelled')
    GROUP BY SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 7)
    ORDER BY month;
    ```


    **Result** (top 7 of 12 rows)

    | month | monthly_revenue | ytd_revenue |
    |---|---|---|
    | 2024-01 | 301,075,320 | 301,075,320 |
    | 2024-02 | 426,177,449 | 727,252,769 |
    | 2024-03 | 536,322,767 | 1,263,575,536 |
    | 2024-04 | 470,154,081 | 1,733,729,617 |
    | 2024-05 | 459,724,596 | 2,193,454,213 |
    | 2024-06 | 377,040,302 | 2,570,494,515 |
    | 2024-07 | 363,944,597 | 2,934,439,112 |

### 3. Identifying duplicate data ★★★


**Find cases where the same customer ordered the same product on the same day (suspected duplicates).
Only the most recent order is marked as valid and the rest are flagged as duplicates.

> **Question frequency**: ★★★ (very high) — LeetCode #196 variant, Kakao

| order_id | customer_name | product_name | ordered_at | is_duplicate |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|


**Hint 1:** - `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, product_id, DATE(ordered_at) ORDER BY ordered_at DESC)`
- Valid if `rn = 1`, duplicate if `rn > 1`



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH order_detail AS (
        SELECT
            o.id AS order_id,
            o.customer_id,
            oi.product_id,
            o.ordered_at,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                PARTITION BY o.customer_id, oi.product_id, DATE(o.ordered_at)
                ORDER BY o.ordered_at DESC
            ) AS rn
        FROM orders AS o
        JOIN order_items AS oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
        WHERE o.status NOT IN ('cancelled')
    )
    SELECT
        od.order_id,
        c.name AS customer_name,
        p.name AS product_name,
        od.ordered_at,
        CASE WHEN od.rn > 1 THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END AS is_duplicate
    FROM order_detail AS od
    JOIN customers AS c ON od.customer_id = c.id
    JOIN products  AS p ON od.product_id  = p.id
    WHERE od.rn <= 2
    ORDER BY od.customer_id, od.product_id, DATE(od.ordered_at), od.rn;
    ```


    **Result** (top 7 of 86,611 rows)

    | order_id | customer_name | product_name | ordered_at | is_duplicate |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | 1049 | Danny Johnson | Razer Blade 18 Black | 2017-12-04 15:52:09 | N |

### 4. Finding the median ★★☆


Find the **median** of the order amount for each customer.
SQLite does not have a `MEDIAN` function, so it is implemented as a window function.

> **Question frequency**: ★★☆ — Google, Amazon

| customer_name | order_count | median_amount |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| ... | ... | ... |


**Hint 1:** - Ranking as `ROW_NUMBER()`, total number of cases as `COUNT(*) OVER()`
- Median = (n+1)/2nd if the total number of cases is odd, average of n/2 and n/2+1 if the total number of cases is even.
- Extract center row with `WHERE rn IN (cnt/2, cnt/2+1, (cnt+1)/2)`



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH numbered AS (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            total_amount,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY total_amount) AS rn,
            COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS cnt
        FROM orders
        WHERE status NOT IN ('cancelled')
    ),
    median_rows AS (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            ROUND(AVG(total_amount), 0) AS median_amount,
            MAX(cnt) AS order_count
        FROM numbered
        WHERE rn IN ((cnt + 1) / 2, (cnt + 2) / 2)
        GROUP BY customer_id
    )
    SELECT
        c.name AS customer_name,
        m.order_count,
        m.median_amount
    FROM median_rows AS m
    JOIN customers AS c ON m.customer_id = c.id
    WHERE m.order_count >= 5
    ORDER BY m.median_amount DESC
    LIMIT 20;
    ```


    **Result** (top 7 of 20 rows)

    | customer_name | order_count | median_amount |
    |---|---|---|
    | Johnny Gutierrez | 5 | 3,162,000.00 |
    | John Brown | 5 | 2,741,600.00 |
    | Abigail Richardson | 5 | 2,461,800.00 |
    | Joanne Jones | 12 | 2,403,150.00 |
    | Jeremy Ellis | 6 | 2,282,947.00 |
    | Margaret Kirk | 5 | 2,281,800.00 |
    | Corey Carroll | 9 | 2,279,500.00 |

### 5. Login for N consecutive days (Islands) ★★★


Consider `product_views` as your login log, and find customers **active for more than 3 consecutive days**.

> **Question frequency**: ★★★ (very high) — Meta, Coupang, LeetCode #180 variant

| customer_name | streak_days | streak_start | streak_end |
|-------------|-----------|------------|----------|


**Hint 1:** - `DATE(viewed_at)` Detect groups of consecutive dates after removing duplicates
- `DATE(viewed_at, '-' || (ROW_NUMBER()-1) || ' days')` → Same value if in the same group
- `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3`



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH active_days AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT
            customer_id,
            DATE(viewed_at) AS active_date
        FROM product_views
    ),
    grouped AS (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            active_date,
            DATE(active_date, '-' || (ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY active_date
            ) - 1) || ' days') AS grp
        FROM active_days
    ),
    streaks AS (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            COUNT(*) AS streak_days,
            MIN(active_date) AS streak_start,
            MAX(active_date) AS streak_end
        FROM grouped
        GROUP BY customer_id, grp
        HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
    )
    SELECT
        c.name AS customer_name,
        s.streak_days,
        s.streak_start,
        s.streak_end
    FROM streaks AS s
    JOIN customers AS c ON s.customer_id = c.id
    ORDER BY s.streak_days DESC, s.streak_start
    LIMIT 20;
    ```


    **Result** (top 7 of 20 rows)

    | customer_name | streak_days | streak_start | streak_end |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Austin Townsend | 46 | 2020-02-28 | 2020-04-13 |

### 6. Top-N by category (ranking within group) ★★★


Extract the **two products with the highest review ratings** from each category.
Only products with 10 or more reviews are eligible. In case of a tie, the product with the most reviews will take precedence.

> **Question frequency**: ★★★ (very high) — Amazon, Naver, Kakao

| category | product_name | avg_rating | review_count | rank |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|------|


**Hint 1:** - Filter number of reviews by `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10`
- `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, review_count DESC)`
- `WHERE rn <= 2`



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH product_ratings AS (
        SELECT
            cat.name AS category,
            p.name   AS product_name,
            ROUND(AVG(r.rating), 2) AS avg_rating,
            COUNT(*)                AS review_count
        FROM reviews AS r
        JOIN products   AS p   ON r.product_id  = p.id
        JOIN categories AS cat ON p.category_id = cat.id
        GROUP BY cat.name, p.id, p.name
        HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
    ),
    ranked AS (
        SELECT *,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                PARTITION BY category
                ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, review_count DESC
            ) AS rn
        FROM product_ratings
    )
    SELECT category, product_name, avg_rating, review_count, rn AS rank
    FROM ranked
    WHERE rn <= 2
    ORDER BY category, rn;
    ```


    **Result** (top 7 of 70 rows)

    | category | product_name | avg_rating | review_count | rank |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | 2-in-1 | HP Pavilion x360 14 Black | 3.79 | 28 | 1 |

### 7. Year-on-year (YoY) growth rate ★★★


Find the year-over-year growth rate (YoY %) of **quarterly sales**.
It covers data from 2023 to 2025.

> **Frequency**: ★★★ (Very High) -- Google, Meta, Coupang

| year | quarter | revenue | prev_year_revenue | yoy_growth_pct |
|------|---------|---------|------------------|---------------|


**Hint 1:** - Refer to sales in the same quarter of the previous year as `LAG(revenue, 4) OVER (ORDER BY year, quarter)` — since quarters are 1 to 4, 4 transitions are the same quarter of the previous year.
- or `LAG(revenue, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter ORDER BY year)`



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH quarterly AS (
        SELECT
            CAST(SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 4) AS INTEGER) AS year,
            CASE
                WHEN CAST(SUBSTR(ordered_at, 6, 2) AS INTEGER) <= 3 THEN 1
                WHEN CAST(SUBSTR(ordered_at, 6, 2) AS INTEGER) <= 6 THEN 2
                WHEN CAST(SUBSTR(ordered_at, 6, 2) AS INTEGER) <= 9 THEN 3
                ELSE 4
            END AS quarter,
            SUM(total_amount) AS revenue
        FROM orders
        WHERE status NOT IN ('cancelled')
          AND ordered_at >= '2023-01-01'
        GROUP BY 1, 2
    )
    SELECT
        year,
        quarter,
        CAST(revenue AS INTEGER) AS revenue,
        CAST(LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter ORDER BY year) AS INTEGER) AS prev_year_revenue,
        ROUND(100.0 * (revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter ORDER BY year))
            / LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter ORDER BY year), 1) AS yoy_growth_pct
    FROM quarterly
    ORDER BY year, quarter;
    ```


    **Result** (top 7 of 12 rows)

    | year | quarter | revenue | prev_year_revenue | yoy_growth_pct |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | 2023 | 1 | 1,112,502,647 | NULL | NULL |

### 8. Moving Average ★★☆


Find the **7-day moving average of daily sales** for 2024.
The moving average is the average of the previous 7 days including the current day.

> **Question frequency**: ★★☆ — Google, Naver

| order_date | daily_revenue | ma_7d |
|-----------|-------------|------|


**Hint 1:** - `AVG(daily_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`
- LEFT JOIN with `calendar` to include days without orders as 0



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH daily AS (
        SELECT
            cal.date_key AS order_date,
            COALESCE(SUM(o.total_amount), 0) AS daily_revenue
        FROM calendar AS cal
        LEFT JOIN orders AS o
            ON DATE(o.ordered_at) = cal.date_key

        WHERE cal.date_key BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
        GROUP BY cal.date_key
    )
    SELECT
        order_date,
        CAST(daily_revenue AS INTEGER) AS daily_revenue,
        CAST(AVG(daily_revenue) OVER (
            ORDER BY order_date
            ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS INTEGER) AS ma_7d
    FROM daily

### 9. Percentile ★★☆


Find the values ​​where the total purchase amount for each customer falls within the **top 10%, 25%, 50% (median), 75%, and 90%** boundaries.

> **Question frequency**: ★★☆ — Amazon, Google

| percentile | threshold_amount |
|-----------|----------------|
| 10 | ... |
| 25 | ... |


**Hint 1:** - Assign percentile group to `NTILE(100) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent)`
- Each percentile boundary value: MAX value in `WHERE percentile_group IN (10, 25, 50, 75, 90)`



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH customer_spent AS (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
        FROM orders
        WHERE status NOT IN ('cancelled')
        GROUP BY customer_id
    ),
    with_percentile AS (
        SELECT
            total_spent,
            NTILE(100) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent) AS pctl
        FROM customer_spent
    )
    SELECT
        pctl AS percentile,
        CAST(MAX(total_spent) AS INTEGER) AS threshold_amount
    FROM with_percentile
    WHERE pctl IN (10, 25, 50, 75, 90)

### 10. Change rate compared to previous day + 7-day moving change rate ★★☆


**Percent change from previous day (DoD %)** for the number of daily orders in December 2024
Find the **change rate (WoW %) compared to 7 days ago** at the same time.

> **Question frequency**: ★★☆ — Meta, Coupang

| order_date | order_count | prev_day | dod_pct | prev_week | wow_pct |
|-----------|------------|---------|--------|----------|--------|


**Hint 1:** - `LAG(order_count, 1)` = the previous day, `LAG(order_count, 7)` = 7 days ago
- Rate of change = `(current_day - previous) / previous * 100`
- `calendar` Includes days missed due to LEFT JOIN



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH daily AS (
        SELECT

### 11. Recursive CTE: Organizational Tree ★★★


Print the **full organizational hierarchy** using `manager_id` in the `staff` table.
Include depth, supervisor name, and full path (CEO > ... > yourself).

> **Question frequency**: ★★★ (very high) — Amazon, Kakao, Naver

| name | department | role | depth | manager_name | path |
|------|-----------|------|-------|-------------|------|
| CEO Name | management | admin | 0 | NULL | CEO Name |
| ... | ... | ... | 1 | CEO Name | CEO Name > ... |


**Hint 1:** - Recursive CTE: `WHERE manager_id IS NULL` is the anchor (root)
- Join with `s.manager_id = tree.id` in the recursive part
- Accumulate paths with `path || ' > ' || s.name`



??? success "Answer"

**Hint 1:** - Recency: Days since last order → `NTILE(5)` (the more recent, the higher the score)
- Frequency: Number of orders → `NTILE(5)`
- Monetary: Total purchase amount → `NTILE(5)`
- Segment classification: R+F+M sum is 13~15=Champions, 10~12=Loyal, 7~9=Potential, 4~6=AtRisk, 3=Lost

### 20. Comprehensive scenario: Marketing campaign effectiveness analysis ★★★


Break down the following by promotions in 2024:
(1) Number of participating customers, (2) Sales during promotion period vs. sales during the previous same period (incremental effect),
(3) Repurchase rate for 30 days after promotion ends; (4) Customer acquisition cost (total discount/number of new customers).

> **Question frequency**: ★★★ (very high) — Coupang, Naver, Meta (comprehensive questions)

| promo_name | promo_type | participants | promo_revenue | pre_revenue | lift_pct | post_repurchase_pct | cac |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|-------------------|-----|


**Hint 1:** - Set period to `started_at`/`ended_at` in `promotions`
- Previous same period: `DATE(started_at, '-' || (julianday(ended_at)-julianday(started_at)) || ' days')`
- New Customer: Customer who placed their first order during the promotion period.
- Separated into CTE levels 4-5
