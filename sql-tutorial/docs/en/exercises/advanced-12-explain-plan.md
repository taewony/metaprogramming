### 1. Check the execution plan for this query. Determine if a full


Check the execution plan for this query. Determine if a full table scan occurs.
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE total_amount > 1000000;
```


**Hint 1:** Check if there's an index on the total_amount column

### 2. Compare execution plans when querying orders by customer_id 


Compare execution plans when querying orders by customer_id vs by status.
Which is more efficient?


**Hint 1:** The idx_orders_customer_id index exists


??? success "Answer"

    === "SQLite"
        ```sql
        EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
        SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 42;
        ```

    === "MySQL"
        ```sql
        EXPLAIN
        SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 42;
        ```

    === "PostgreSQL"
        ```sql
        EXPLAIN ANALYZE
        SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 42;
        ```

    === "Oracle"
        ```sql
        EXPLAIN PLAN FOR
        SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 42;
        SELECT * FROM TABLE(DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY());
        ```

### 3. There's a composite index idx_orders_customer_status(custome


There's a composite index idx_orders_customer_status(customer_id, status).
Which of these queries uses this index?
(A) WHERE customer_id = 42 AND status = 'confirmed'
(B) WHERE status = 'confirmed'


**Hint 1:** A composite index requires the first column in the WHERE clause

        EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
        SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 42 AND status = 'confirmed';

### 4. Compare execution plans of two equivalent queries:


Compare execution plans of two equivalent queries:
(A) Subquery: SELECT * FROM products WHERE id IN (SELECT product_id FROM order_items WHERE order_id = 100)
(B) JOIN: SELECT p.* FROM products p JOIN order_items oi ON p.id = oi.product_id WHERE oi.order_id = 100
Which is more efficient?


**Hint 1:** Run EXPLAIN on both the subquery and JOIN versions


??? success "Answer"

        ```sql
        EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
        SELECT p.* FROM products p

### 5. When querying only brand and price from products,


When querying only brand and price from products,
check if a covering index effect occurs.
Compare with the idx_products_name index.


**Hint 1:** A covering index returns results from the index alone without table access

Analyze the execution plan of a running total query using window functions
on point_transactions (~130K rows). Check for temp tables or sort operations.


**Hint 1:** Window functions require internal sorting

### 8. Analyze this slow query's execution plan and rewrite it more


Analyze this slow query's execution plan and rewrite it more efficiently.
```sql
SELECT c.name, c.email,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.id) AS order_count,

FROM customers c
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.id) > 10;
