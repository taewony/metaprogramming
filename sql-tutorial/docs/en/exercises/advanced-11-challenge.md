### 1. Duplicate Review Detection


Find customers who reviewed the same product more than once.
Show customer name, product name, and review count.


**Hint 1:** - JOIN `reviews` with `customers` and `products`
- `GROUP BY customer_id, product_id` then `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2`



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.name AS customer_name,

### 14. Top 3 Products by Revenue per Category


Use ROW_NUMBER to find the top 3 products by revenue per category.
Show category, rank, product name, and revenue.


**Hint 1:** - `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY cat.id ORDER BY revenue DESC)`
- `WHERE rn <= 3`



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH product_revenue AS (
        SELECT
            cat.name AS category,
            cat.id AS category_id,
            p.name AS product_name,
            ROUND(SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price), 2) AS revenue,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                PARTITION BY cat.id
                ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) DESC
            ) AS rn
        FROM order_items AS oi
        INNER JOIN orders AS o ON oi.order_id = o.id

    )
    SELECT category, rn AS rank, product_name, revenue
    FROM product_revenue
    WHERE rn <= 3
    ORDER BY category, rn;
    ```

### 15. Mentoring Pair Matching


Match junior staff (role='staff') with seniors (role='manager')
in the same department as mentor-mentee pairs.
Show department, mentee name, and mentor name.


**Hint 1:** - Self-join `staff`: `s1.department = s2.department`
- `s1.role = 'staff'` AND `s2.role = 'manager'`



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        s1.department,
        s1.name AS mentee,
        s1.role AS mentee_role,

### 16. Classic Retention Analysis


By signup month (cohort), calculate the percentage of customers
who ordered again in month+1, month+2, and month+3.


**Hint 1:** - Cohort = `SUBSTR(customers.created_at, 1, 7)`
- Calculate "months since signup" for each order
- Use `COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ... THEN customer_id END)`

### 17. Rolling Retention Analysis


By signup month cohort, calculate the % of customers who ordered
in ANY month after N months (not just exactly month N).


**Hint 1:** - Use `months_since_signup >= N` for "any time after N months"
- Always >= classic retention values

### 18. DAU/MAU Stickiness Ratio


For December 2024, calculate daily active users (DAU) and monthly active users (MAU)
from product_views. DAU/MAU ratio is the stickiness metric.


**Hint 1:** - DAU = daily `COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)`
- MAU = monthly `COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)` (subquery)
- Stickiness = DAU / MAU

### 30. 3+ Consecutive Days of Increasing Revenue


Find periods of 3+ consecutive days with increasing daily revenue.
Show start date, end date, and streak length.


**Hint 1:** - Use LAG to flag daily revenue increases
- Use flag breaks as group boundaries (island pattern)
- Filter groups with streak >= 3

### 32. Session Definition (30-min Gap)


Group product_views into sessions (30+ minute gap = new session for same customer).
Calculate sessions per customer and average views per session.

### 33. Session Redefinition (10-min Gap)


Same as c11-32 but with a 10-minute gap threshold.
Compare session counts with the 30-minute version.


**Hint 1:** - Just change 30 to 10
- Sessions will split more frequently

### 34. Median Order Amount by Customer Grade


Calculate the median order amount per customer grade.
SQLite lacks MEDIAN, so implement it using NTILE or ROW_NUMBER.


**Hint 1:** - `ROW_NUMBER()` OVER (PARTITION BY grade ORDER BY total_amount)
- Median is at half of total count
- `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY grade)` for total count

### 37. Channel Attribution Analysis


Calculate views and purchase conversions by referrer_source.
For multi-channel customers, give credit to the last-touch channel before purchase.


**Hint 1:** - Get last referrer_source per customer (most recent product_view)
- Credit that channel for conversion



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH last_touch AS (
        SELECT
            pv.customer_id,
            pv.referrer_source,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                PARTITION BY pv.customer_id
                ORDER BY pv.viewed_at DESC
            ) AS rn
        FROM product_views AS pv
        INNER JOIN orders AS o ON pv.customer_id = o.customer_id
        WHERE o.status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'returned', 'return_requested')
    ),
    channel_views AS (
        SELECT
            referrer_source,
            COUNT(*) AS total_views,
            COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_viewers
        FROM product_views
        GROUP BY referrer_source

        FROM last_touch
        WHERE rn = 1
        GROUP BY referrer_source
    )
    SELECT
        cv.referrer_source,

    FROM channel_views AS cv
    LEFT JOIN channel_conversions AS cc ON cv.referrer_source = cc.referrer_source
    ORDER BY last_touch_conversions DESC;

### 38. Active Day Island Detection


Find "islands" of consecutive active days per customer in product_views.
e.g., Mon/Tue/Wed views -> Thu gap -> Fri/Sat views = 2 islands (3 days, 2 days).
