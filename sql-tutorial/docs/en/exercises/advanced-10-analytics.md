### 1. Point Running Total Verification


Verify point_transactions.balance_after using SUM() OVER().
For a specific customer (e.g., id=100), list point transactions chronologically
and compare calculated running total with balance_after.


**Hint 1:** - Use `SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY created_at, id)`
- `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`
- Compare with `balance_after` to find discrepancies



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        id,
        type,
        reason,
        amount,
        balance_after,
        SUM(amount) OVER (
            ORDER BY created_at, id
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS calculated_balance,
        balance_after - SUM(amount) OVER (
            ORDER BY created_at, id
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS diff,
        created_at
    FROM point_transactions
    WHERE customer_id = 100
    ORDER BY created_at, id;
    ```


    **Result** (1 rows)

    | id | type | reason | amount | balance_after | calculated_balance | diff | created_at |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | 225 | earn | signup | 4421 | 4421 | 4421 | 0 | 2016-04-04 02:36:11 |

### 2. Grade Change History Tracking (LAG)


Use LAG() on customer_grade_history to fetch the previous grade before each change.
Also verify if old_grade matches the LAG result.


**Hint 1:** - `LAG(new_grade) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY changed_at)`
- Previous record's new_grade should match current record's old_grade



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH grade_changes AS (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            old_grade,
            new_grade,
            reason,
            changed_at,
            LAG(new_grade) OVER (
                PARTITION BY customer_id
                ORDER BY changed_at
            ) AS prev_new_grade
        FROM customer_grade_history
    )
    SELECT
        gc.customer_id,
        c.name,
        gc.old_grade,
        gc.new_grade,
        gc.prev_new_grade,
        CASE
            WHEN gc.old_grade = gc.prev_new_grade THEN 'OK'
            WHEN gc.prev_new_grade IS NULL THEN 'FIRST'
            ELSE 'MISMATCH'
        END AS check_status,
        gc.reason,
        gc.changed_at
    FROM grade_changes AS gc
    INNER JOIN customers AS c ON gc.customer_id = c.id
    WHERE gc.prev_new_grade IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY gc.customer_id, gc.changed_at
    LIMIT 30;
    ```

### 3. Funnel Analysis: View -> Cart -> Purchase


Using product_views, cart_items, and order_items,
calculate conversion rates for the funnel: view -> add to cart -> purchase.


**Hint 1:** - Count unique customer-product pairs at each stage
- The funnel requires the same customer viewing the same product
- Use scalar subqueries or CTEs



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    WITH funnel AS (
        SELECT
            (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id || '-' || product_id)
             FROM product_views) AS step1_views,
            (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id || '-' || ci.product_id)
             FROM cart_items ci
             INNER JOIN carts c ON ci.cart_id = c.id) AS step2_cart,
            (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id || '-' || oi.product_id)
             FROM order_items oi
             INNER JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.id
             WHERE o.status NOT IN ('cancelled')) AS step3_purchase
    )
    SELECT
        step1_views,
        step2_cart,
        ROUND(100.0 * step2_cart / step1_views, 2) AS view_to_cart_pct,
        step3_purchase,
        ROUND(100.0 * step3_purchase / step2_cart, 2) AS cart_to_purchase_pct,
        ROUND(100.0 * step3_purchase / step1_views, 2) AS view_to_purchase_pct
    FROM funnel;
    ```


    **Result** (1 rows)

    | step1_views | step2_cart | view_to_cart_pct | step3_purchase | cart_to_purchase_pct | view_to_purchase_pct |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | 120,970 | 8918 | 7.37 | 63,835 | 715.80 | 52.77 |

### 4. Session Analysis: Product View Sessions


Group product_views into sessions.
A gap of 30+ minutes between views by the same customer starts a new session.
Calculate average sessions per customer and average views per session.


**Hint 1:** - `LAG(viewed_at) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY viewed_at)`
- If time gap > 30 minutes, mark as new session
- `SUM(new_session_flag) OVER (...)` to assign session numbers

### 6. Promotion Effectiveness Analysis


Compare order amounts for promotion products during vs outside promotion periods.
Calculate revenue change rate per promotion.


**Hint 1:** - Get target products from `promotion_products`
- Promotion period: `promotions.started_at` to `ended_at`
- Separate during/outside revenue with CASE

### 10. RFM with Grade History Trend Analysis


Combine RFM analysis with grade history to analyze
the RFM score distribution of downgraded customers.
Compare RFM differences between downgraded vs maintained/upgraded customers.


**Hint 1:** - Identify downgraded customers from grade history
- Calculate RFM scores in a separate CTE
- JOIN both results for group comparison

### 11. Grade Upgrade History


Find customers who were upgraded to VIP.
Show customer name, previous grade, change date, and reason.


**Hint 1:** - Filter `customer_grade_history.new_grade = 'VIP'`
- Filter `customer_grade_history.reason = 'upgrade'`
- JOIN `customers` for customer info



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.name          AS customer_name,
        c.email,
        cgh.old_grade,
        cgh.new_grade,
        cgh.changed_at,
        cgh.reason
    FROM customer_grade_history AS cgh
    INNER JOIN customers AS c ON cgh.customer_id = c.id
    WHERE cgh.new_grade = 'VIP'
      AND cgh.reason = 'upgrade'
    ORDER BY cgh.changed_at DESC
    LIMIT 20;
    ```


    **Result** (top 7 of 20 rows)

### 12. Point Balance Verification


Compare the sum of point_transactions with customers.point_balance
to find customers with mismatches.


**Hint 1:** - Calculate total with `SUM(amount)` from point_transactions
- Compare with `customers.point_balance`
- Use `HAVING` to filter mismatches



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.id          AS customer_id,
        c.name,
        c.point_balance AS current_balance,
        SUM(pt.amount)  AS calculated_balance,
        c.point_balance - SUM(pt.amount) AS difference
    FROM customers AS c
    INNER JOIN point_transactions AS pt ON c.id = pt.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.point_balance
    HAVING ABS(c.point_balance - SUM(pt.amount)) > 0
    ORDER BY ABS(difference) DESC
    LIMIT 20;
    ```


    **Result** (top 7 of 20 rows)
