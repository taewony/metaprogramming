!!! abstract "Concepts"

    `CREATE VIEW`, `DROP VIEW`, `CREATE TRIGGER`, `AFTER/BEFORE`, `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE`, `OLD/NEW`, `Audit Logging`



### 1. Create monthly sales summary views.


View name: `v_monthly_revenue`. Columns: Year Month, Number of Orders, Total Sales, Average Order Amount.
Excludes canceled/returned orders.


**Hint 1:** Define the view as `CREATE VIEW v_monthly_revenue AS SELECT ...`.
You can use `GROUP BY` inside a view.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW v_monthly_revenue AS
    SELECT
        SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 7)   AS year_month,
        COUNT(*)                    AS order_count,
        ROUND(SUM(total_amount), 0) AS total_revenue,
        ROUND(AVG(total_amount), 0) AS avg_order_value
    FROM orders
    WHERE status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'returned', 'return_requested')
    GROUP BY SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 7);
    
    -- 뷰 사용
    SELECT *
    FROM v_monthly_revenue
    WHERE year_month LIKE '2024%'
    ORDER BY year_month;
    ```


---


### 2. Create a customer dashboard view


View name: `v_customer_dashboard`. Includes basic information for each customer, total number of orders, total purchase amount, last order date, and number of reviews.


**Hint 1:** Linking orders and reviews with `LEFT JOIN` may cause double counting issues.
It is safer to aggregate each by subquery or CTE and then join.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW v_customer_dashboard AS
    WITH order_stats AS (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            COUNT(*)              AS order_count,
            ROUND(SUM(total_amount), 0) AS total_spent,
            MAX(ordered_at)       AS last_order_date
        FROM orders
        WHERE status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'returned', 'return_requested')
        GROUP BY customer_id
    ),
    review_stats AS (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            COUNT(*) AS review_count
        FROM reviews
        GROUP BY customer_id
    )
    SELECT
        c.id              AS customer_id,
        c.name,
        c.email,
        c.grade,
        c.created_at      AS signup_date,
        COALESCE(os.order_count, 0)   AS order_count,
        COALESCE(os.total_spent, 0)   AS total_spent,
        os.last_order_date,
        COALESCE(rs.review_count, 0)  AS review_count
    FROM customers AS c
    LEFT JOIN order_stats  AS os ON c.id = os.customer_id
    LEFT JOIN review_stats AS rs ON c.id = rs.customer_id;
    
    -- VIP 고객 조회
    SELECT *
    FROM v_customer_dashboard
    WHERE grade = 'VIP'
    ORDER BY total_spent DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```


---


### 3. Create product performance views and use them to analyze sales efficiency relative to inventory.


View name: `v_product_performance`. Includes total sales, revenue, current inventory, and average rating for each product.


**Hint 1:** When creating a view, also include products without reviews as `LEFT JOIN`.
When querying a view, you can add derived columns such as "Inventory Turnover" (`units_sold / stock_qty`).



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW v_product_performance AS
    SELECT
        p.id              AS product_id,
        p.name            AS product_name,
        cat.name          AS category,
        p.price,
        p.stock_qty,
        COALESCE(SUM(oi.quantity), 0) AS total_sold,
        COALESCE(ROUND(SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price), 0), 0) AS total_revenue,
        COALESCE(r.review_count, 0)   AS review_count,
        r.avg_rating
    FROM products AS p
    INNER JOIN categories AS cat ON p.category_id = cat.id
    LEFT JOIN order_items AS oi ON p.id = oi.product_id
    LEFT JOIN orders AS o ON oi.order_id = o.id
        AND o.status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'returned', 'return_requested')
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT
            product_id,
            COUNT(*) AS review_count,
            ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating
        FROM reviews
        GROUP BY product_id
    ) AS r ON p.id = r.product_id
    WHERE p.is_active = 1
    GROUP BY p.id, p.name, cat.name, p.price, p.stock_qty,
             r.review_count, r.avg_rating;
    
    -- 재고 대비 판매 효율 분석
    SELECT
        product_name,
        category,
        total_sold,
        stock_qty,
        CASE
            WHEN stock_qty > 0
            THEN ROUND(1.0 * total_sold / stock_qty, 2)
            ELSE NULL
        END AS turnover_ratio,
        total_revenue,
        avg_rating
    FROM v_product_performance
    WHERE total_sold > 0
    ORDER BY turnover_ratio DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```


---


### 4. Nested query using views — Find year-on-year growth rate in monthly sales view.


Self-join the `v_monthly_revenue` created earlier.


**Hint 1:** It references `v_monthly_revenue` twice.
JOIN condition: The "month part" of the current month is the same as the "month part" of the previous year, and the year is 1 different.
Extract the month part with `SUBSTR(year_month, 6, 2)` and the year with `SUBSTR(year_month, 1, 4)`.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        curr.year_month,
        curr.total_revenue      AS current_revenue,
        prev.total_revenue      AS prev_year_revenue,
        curr.total_revenue - prev.total_revenue AS diff,
        ROUND(100.0 * (curr.total_revenue - prev.total_revenue)
            / prev.total_revenue, 1) AS yoy_growth_pct
    FROM v_monthly_revenue AS curr
    INNER JOIN v_monthly_revenue AS prev
        ON SUBSTR(curr.year_month, 6, 2) = SUBSTR(prev.year_month, 6, 2)
       AND CAST(SUBSTR(curr.year_month, 1, 4) AS INTEGER)
         = CAST(SUBSTR(prev.year_month, 1, 4) AS INTEGER) + 1
    WHERE curr.year_month LIKE '2024%'
    ORDER BY curr.year_month;
    ```


---


### 5. Check the list of all views that currently exist in the DB.


It uses SQLite's system catalog.


**Hint 1:** In SQLite, all DB object information is stored in the `sqlite_master` table.
Filter by `type = 'view'`.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        name,
        type,
        sql
    FROM sqlite_master
    WHERE type = 'view'
    ORDER BY name;
    ```


    **Result** (top 7 of 18 rows)

    | name | type | sql |
    |---|---|---|
    | v_cart_abandonment | view | CREATE VIEW v_cart_abandonment AS
SEL... |
    | v_category_tree | view | CREATE VIEW v_category_tree AS
WITH R... |
    | v_coupon_effectiveness | view | CREATE VIEW v_coupon_effectiveness AS... |
    | v_customer_rfm | view | CREATE VIEW v_customer_rfm AS
WITH rf... |
    | v_customer_summary | view | CREATE VIEW v_customer_summary AS
SEL... |
    | v_daily_orders | view | CREATE VIEW v_daily_orders AS
SELECT
... |
    | v_hourly_pattern | view | CREATE VIEW v_hourly_pattern AS
SELEC... |


---


### 6. Drop the view and recreate it (DROP + CREATE).


Regenerate the `v_monthly_revenue` view by adding a column for increase/decrease compared to the previous month.


**Hint 1:** SQLite does not support `ALTER VIEW`, so delete and recreate it as `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS`.
You can use the window function `LAG` inside a view definition.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_monthly_revenue;
    
    CREATE VIEW v_monthly_revenue AS
    WITH base AS (
        SELECT
            SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 7)   AS year_month,
            COUNT(*)                    AS order_count,
            ROUND(SUM(total_amount), 0) AS total_revenue,
            ROUND(AVG(total_amount), 0) AS avg_order_value
        FROM orders
        WHERE status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'returned', 'return_requested')
        GROUP BY SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 7)
    )
    SELECT
        year_month,
        order_count,
        total_revenue,
        avg_order_value,
        LAG(total_revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY year_month) AS prev_month_revenue,
        ROUND(100.0 * (total_revenue - LAG(total_revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY year_month))
            / LAG(total_revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY year_month), 1) AS mom_growth_pct
    FROM base;
    
    -- 개선된 뷰 확인
    SELECT *
    FROM v_monthly_revenue
    WHERE year_month LIKE '2024%'
    ORDER BY year_month;
    ```

### 7. Simulate the Materialized View concept in SQLite.


A regular view executes the query every time, but a “materialized view” stores the results in a table.
Save statistics for each product as a table and implement an update pattern.


**Hint 1:** Save the results to a table with `CREATE TABLE mv_product_stats AS SELECT ...`.
On update, run `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` + `CREATE TABLE AS` again.
Since SQLite does not support native MATERIALIZED VIEW, this pattern is an alternative.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    -- 1. 구체화된 뷰 생성 (테이블로 저장)
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mv_product_stats;
    
    CREATE TABLE mv_product_stats AS
    SELECT
        p.id              AS product_id,
        p.name            AS product_name,
        cat.name          AS category,
        COALESCE(SUM(oi.quantity), 0) AS total_sold,
        COALESCE(ROUND(SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price), 0), 0) AS total_revenue,
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reviews AS r WHERE r.product_id = p.id) AS review_count,
        (SELECT ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) FROM reviews AS r WHERE r.product_id = p.id) AS avg_rating,
        DATETIME('now') AS refreshed_at
    FROM products AS p
    INNER JOIN categories AS cat ON p.category_id = cat.id
    LEFT JOIN order_items AS oi ON p.id = oi.product_id
    LEFT JOIN orders AS o ON oi.order_id = o.id
        AND o.status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'returned', 'return_requested')
    WHERE p.is_active = 1
    GROUP BY p.id, p.name, cat.name;
    
    -- 2. 구체화된 뷰 사용 (인덱스 생성 가능 — 일반 뷰와의 차이점)
    CREATE INDEX idx_mv_product_stats_revenue ON mv_product_stats(total_revenue);
    
    SELECT *
    FROM mv_product_stats
    ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```


---


### 8. Check the list of triggers that currently exist in the DB.


Displays the trigger name, associated table, and definition (SQL).


**Hint 1:** Filter from `sqlite_master` to `type = 'trigger'`.
The `tbl_name` column is the table to which the trigger is attached.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        name       AS trigger_name,
        tbl_name   AS table_name,
        sql        AS definition
    FROM sqlite_master
    WHERE type = 'trigger'
    ORDER BY tbl_name, name;
    ```


    **Result** (5 rows)

    | trigger_name | table_name | definition |
    |---|---|---|
    | trg_customers_updated_at | customers | CREATE TRIGGER trg_customers_updated_... |
    | trg_orders_updated_at | orders | CREATE TRIGGER trg_orders_updated_at
... |
    | trg_product_price_history | products | CREATE TRIGGER trg_product_price_hist... |
    | trg_products_updated_at | products | CREATE TRIGGER trg_products_updated_a... |
    | trg_reviews_updated_at | reviews | CREATE TRIGGER trg_reviews_updated_at... |


---


### 9. Create order status change audit log tables and triggers.


Automatically logs changes to `status` in the `orders` table.


**Hint 1:** First, create the audit log table as `CREATE TABLE`,
to `CREATE TRIGGER ... AFTER UPDATE OF status ON orders WHEN OLD.status != NEW.status`
Record the status before and after the change. `OLD` is the value before the change, and `NEW` is the value after the change.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    -- 1. 감사 로그 테이블 생성
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS order_status_log (
        id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        order_id    INTEGER NOT NULL,
        old_status  TEXT NOT NULL,
        new_status  TEXT NOT NULL,
        changed_at  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (DATETIME('now'))
    );
    
    -- 2. 트리거 생성
    CREATE TRIGGER trg_order_status_change
    AFTER UPDATE OF status ON orders
    WHEN OLD.status != NEW.status
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO order_status_log (order_id, old_status, new_status)
        VALUES (NEW.id, OLD.status, NEW.status);
    END;
    
    -- 3. 테스트: 주문 상태 변경
    UPDATE orders SET status = 'shipped' WHERE id = 1 AND status = 'preparing';
    
    -- 4. 로그 확인
    SELECT * FROM order_status_log ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;
    ```


---


### 10. Create automatic inventory deduction triggers.


When a new row is inserted in `order_items`, `stock_qty` for that product is automatically deducted.


**Hint 1:** Use `CREATE TRIGGER ... AFTER INSERT ON order_items`.
`UPDATE products SET stock_qty = stock_qty - NEW.quantity WHERE id = NEW.product_id;`



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER trg_stock_deduct
    AFTER INSERT ON order_items
    BEGIN
        UPDATE products
        SET stock_qty = stock_qty - NEW.quantity,
            updated_at = DATETIME('now')
        WHERE id = NEW.product_id;
    END;
    
    -- 테스트: 현재 재고 확인
    SELECT id, name, stock_qty FROM products WHERE id = 1;
    
    -- order_items에 삽입 (실제 운영에서는 주문 프로세스에서 발생)
    -- INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price, discount_amount, subtotal)
    -- VALUES (1, 1, 2, 2987500, 0, 5975000);
    
    -- 재고가 2 감소했는지 확인
    -- SELECT id, name, stock_qty FROM products WHERE id = 1;
    ```


---


### 11. Create automatic point accumulation triggers when you write a review.


When a new review is inserted into `reviews`, you will earn 500 points for that customer.
Applies only to purchase reviews verified by the `WHEN NEW.is_verified = 1` condition.


**Hint 1:** You need to perform two actions:
1. Increment `point_balance` in table `customers`
2. Insert accrual record into `point_transactions` table
Multiple SQL statements can be executed in the trigger body.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER trg_review_point
    AFTER INSERT ON reviews
    WHEN NEW.is_verified = 1
    BEGIN
        -- 1. 포인트 잔액 증가
        UPDATE customers
        SET point_balance = point_balance + 500,
            updated_at = DATETIME('now')
        WHERE id = NEW.customer_id;
    
        -- 2. 포인트 이력 기록
        INSERT INTO point_transactions (
            customer_id, order_id, type, reason, amount,
            balance_after, expires_at, created_at
        )
        VALUES (
            NEW.customer_id,
            NEW.order_id,
            'earn',
            'review',
            500,
            (SELECT point_balance FROM customers WHERE id = NEW.customer_id),
            DATE('now', '+1 year'),
            DATETIME('now')
        );
    END;
    
    -- 트리거 확인
    SELECT name, sql
    FROM sqlite_master
    WHERE type = 'trigger' AND name = 'trg_review_point';
    ```


---


### 12. Create a trigger to automatically record product price change history.


When `price` of `products` is changed, the history is automatically recorded in the `product_prices` table.
Updates `ended_at` in the old price record to the current time and inserts a new price record.


**Hint 1:** Use `AFTER UPDATE OF price ON products WHEN OLD.price != NEW.price`.
Step 1: Update `ended_at` of an existing record (`WHERE product_id = NEW.id AND ended_at IS NULL`).
Step 2: Insert a new record.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER trg_price_history
    AFTER UPDATE OF price ON products
    WHEN OLD.price != NEW.price
    BEGIN
        -- 1. 이전 가격 레코드 종료
        UPDATE product_prices
        SET ended_at = DATETIME('now')
        WHERE product_id = NEW.id
          AND ended_at IS NULL;
    
        -- 2. 새 가격 레코드 생성
        INSERT INTO product_prices (product_id, price, started_at, change_reason)
        VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.price, DATETIME('now'), 'price_drop');
    END;
    
    -- 테스트: 가격 변경
    -- UPDATE products SET price = 2800000, updated_at = DATETIME('now') WHERE id = 1;
    
    -- 이력 확인
    SELECT *
    FROM product_prices
    WHERE product_id = 1
    ORDER BY started_at DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```


---


### 13. Create a delete protection trigger.


Confirmed orders (status = 'confirmed' or 'delivered') cannot be deleted.
When attempting to delete, an error occurs with `RAISE(ABORT, ...)`.


**Hint 1:** Use `BEFORE DELETE ON orders`.
In condition `WHEN OLD.status IN ('confirmed', 'delivered')`
Run `RAISE(ABORT, 'Confirmed orders cannot be deleted.')`.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER trg_prevent_order_delete
    BEFORE DELETE ON orders
    WHEN OLD.status IN ('confirmed', 'delivered')
    BEGIN
        SELECT RAISE(ABORT, '확정/배송 완료된 주문은 삭제할 수 없습니다.');
    END;
    
    -- 테스트: 확정된 주문 삭제 시도
    -- DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 100 AND status = 'confirmed';
    -- 결과: Error: 확정/배송 완료된 주문은 삭제할 수 없습니다.
    
    -- 트리거 확인
    SELECT name, sql
    FROM sqlite_master
    WHERE type = 'trigger' AND name = 'trg_prevent_order_delete';
    ```


---


### 14. Practice trigger deletion and conditional regeneration.


Delete the existing `trg_stock_deduct` trigger and recreate it with an improved version that raises an error when out of stock.


**Hint 1:** Delete with `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trg_stock_deduct;`.
The improved trigger uses `BEFORE INSERT`,
If inventory is low, insertion itself is prevented with `RAISE(ABORT, ...)`.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    -- 1. 기존 트리거 삭제
    DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trg_stock_deduct;
    
    -- 2. 재고 검증 트리거 (BEFORE)
    CREATE TRIGGER trg_stock_check
    BEFORE INSERT ON order_items
    WHEN (SELECT stock_qty FROM products WHERE id = NEW.product_id) < NEW.quantity
    BEGIN
        SELECT RAISE(ABORT, '재고가 부족합니다.');
    END;
    
    -- 3. 재고 차감 트리거 (AFTER)
    CREATE TRIGGER trg_stock_deduct
    AFTER INSERT ON order_items
    BEGIN
        UPDATE products
        SET stock_qty = stock_qty - NEW.quantity,
            updated_at = DATETIME('now')
        WHERE id = NEW.product_id;
    
        -- 재고 변동 이력 기록
        INSERT INTO inventory_transactions (
            product_id, type, quantity, reference_id, notes, created_at
        )
        VALUES (
            NEW.product_id, 'outbound', -NEW.quantity,
            NEW.order_id, 'order_deduction', DATETIME('now')
        );
    END;
    
    -- 트리거 확인
    SELECT name, tbl_name, sql
    FROM sqlite_master
    WHERE type = 'trigger'
      AND name IN ('trg_stock_check', 'trg_stock_deduct')
    ORDER BY name;
    ```

### 15. Check out stored procedure-like functionality in SQLite.


Count the number of all tables, views, triggers, and indexes in the current DB from the system catalog.


**Hint 1:** Returns `COUNT(*)` from `sqlite_master` by `type`.
You can know the number of each type with `GROUP BY type`.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        type,
        COUNT(*) AS object_count
    FROM sqlite_master
    WHERE type IN ('table', 'view', 'trigger', 'index')
    GROUP BY type
    ORDER BY
        CASE type
            WHEN 'table' THEN 1
            WHEN 'view' THEN 2
            WHEN 'index' THEN 3
            WHEN 'trigger' THEN 4
        END;
    ```


    **Result** (4 rows)

    | type | object_count |
    |---|---|
    | table | 32 |
    | view | 18 |
    | index | 73 |
    | trigger | 5 |

### 16. Design a customer rating renewal process.


Customer levels are recalculated based on annual purchase amount:
VIP (5 million won or more), GOLD (3 to 5 million won), SILVER (1 to 3 million won), BRONZE (less than 1 million won).


**Hint 1:** Use `CREATE PROCEDURE` in MySQL and `CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE` in PostgreSQL.
Update each customer's rating using a cursor or the UPDATE ... FROM pattern.



??? success "Answer"
    ```sql

### 17. Design a month-end settlement procedure.


Calculates a sales summary for a specific month and stores it in a settlement table.


**Hint 1:** It takes the year and month (`p_year_month`) as a parameter.

### 18. Design inventory replenishment procedures.


Find products that are below the safety stock (threshold) and create an automatic order request.


**Hint 1:** It takes the safety stock standard (e.g. 20 units) as a parameter.

### 19. Design a customer activity summary function.


Takes a specific customer ID and returns a comprehensive activity summary (orders/reviews/points/CS) for that customer as JSON.

Each indicator is obtained as a subquery and combined into `JSON_OBJECT`/`jsonb_build_object`.

### 20. Design transaction-based order processing procedures.


The entire process of order creation (Create order record -> Create order item -> Deduct inventory -> Create payment -> Earn points)
Encapsulate it in one procedure. If there is an intermediate failure, there is a full rollback.


**Hint 1:** Use `START TRANSACTION ... COMMIT` in MySQL and `BEGIN ... COMMIT` in PostgreSQL.
If an error occurs, cancel entirely with `ROLLBACK`.
Utilizes MySQL's `DECLARE ... HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION` and PostgreSQL's `EXCEPTION WHEN` blocks.
