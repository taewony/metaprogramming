# Lesson 18: Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations over a set of rows related to the current row without collapsing results like `GROUP BY`. Each row retains its unique identity while gaining access to aggregate or ranking information.

Syntax: `function() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)`

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Partition: Customer A"
        R1["Row 1: 50,000"]
        R2["Row 2: 80,000"]
        R3["Row 3: 30,000"]
    end
    subgraph "Window Frame"
        W["SUM() OVER\n(ORDER BY date\nROWS BETWEEN\n1 PRECEDING\nAND CURRENT)"]
    end
    R1 -.->|"frame"| W
    R2 -.->|"frame"| W
    W --> O1["50,000"]
    W --> O2["130,000"]
    W --> O3["110,000"]
```

> Window functions do not group rows; they compute from neighboring rows for each row. The number of result rows does not decrease.

### Window Frame Types

The `ROWS BETWEEN` clause specifies the range of the window. The computation result varies depending on the frame.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph frame1["Default Frame (cumulative)"]
        direction TB
        F1["UNBOUNDED PRECEDING"]
        F2["↓ All preceding rows"]
        F3["CURRENT ROW ← up to here"]
    end
    subgraph frame2["Moving Average (3 rows)"]
        direction TB
        G1["2 PRECEDING"]
        G2["1 PRECEDING"]
        G3["CURRENT ROW"]
    end
    subgraph frame3["Entire Partition"]
        direction TB
        H1["UNBOUNDED PRECEDING"]
        H2["↓ All rows"]
        H3["UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING"]
    end
```

| Frame | Use Case | Example |
|--------|------|------|
| `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` | Running total (default) | Daily cumulative revenue |
| `ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` | Moving average | 3-month moving average |
| `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` | Entire partition | Required for LAST_VALUE |


!!! note "Already familiar?"
    If you are comfortable with window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, SUM OVER), skip ahead to [Lesson 19: CTE](19-cte.md).

## ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK

Ranking functions assign a rank to each row within a partition.

| Function | Tie Handling | Rank Gaps |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| `ROW_NUMBER()` | Assigns arbitrary rank | — |
| `RANK()` | Same rank for ties | Yes (1,1,3) |
| `DENSE_RANK()` | Same rank for ties | No (1,1,2) |

```sql
-- Rank products by price within each category
SELECT
    cat.name            AS category,
    p.name              AS product_name,
    p.price,
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY p.category_id
        ORDER BY p.price DESC
    ) AS price_rank
FROM products AS p
INNER JOIN categories AS cat ON p.category_id = cat.id
WHERE p.is_active = 1
ORDER BY cat.name, price_rank
LIMIT 12;
```

**Result (example):**

| category | product_name | price | price_rank |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------: | ----------: |
| 2-in-1 | Lenovo ThinkPad X1 2in1 Silver | 1866100.0 | 1 |
| 2-in-1 | Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 White | 1524800.0 | 2 |
| 2-in-1 | HP Pavilion x360 14 Black | 1479700.0 | 3 |
| 2-in-1 | Samsung Galaxy Book4 360 Black | 1388600.0 | 4 |
| 2-in-1 | Samsung Galaxy Book4 360 Black | 1267000.0 | 5 |
| 2-in-1 | HP Envy x360 15 Silver | 1214600.0 | 6 |
| 2-in-1 | Samsung Galaxy Book5 360 Black | 1179900.0 | 7 |
| AMD | AMD Ryzen 9 9900X | 591800.0 | 1 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Top-N per Group

Wrapping a ranked query in a CTE or subquery lets you extract the top N items per partition.

```sql
-- Top 3 products per category by sales volume (units sold)
WITH ranked_sales AS (
    SELECT
        cat.name                        AS category,
        p.name                          AS product_name,
        SUM(oi.quantity)                AS units_sold,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY p.category_id
            ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity) DESC
        ) AS sales_rank
    FROM order_items AS oi
    INNER JOIN products   AS p   ON oi.product_id = p.id
    INNER JOIN categories AS cat ON p.category_id = cat.id
    INNER JOIN orders     AS o   ON oi.order_id   = o.id
    WHERE o.status IN ('delivered', 'confirmed')
    GROUP BY p.category_id, p.id, p.name, cat.name
)
SELECT category, product_name, units_sold, sales_rank
FROM ranked_sales
WHERE sales_rank <= 3
ORDER BY category, sales_rank;
```

## SUM OVER — Running Totals

`SUM() OVER (ORDER BY ...)` computes a running total.

```sql
-- Monthly cumulative revenue for 2024
SELECT
    SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 7) AS year_month,
    SUM(total_amount)        AS monthly_revenue,
    SUM(SUM(total_amount)) OVER (
        ORDER BY SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 7)
    ) AS cumulative_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE ordered_at LIKE '2024%'
  AND status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'returned')
GROUP BY SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 7)
ORDER BY year_month;
```

**Result (example):**

| year_month | monthly_revenue | cumulative_revenue |
| ---------- | ----------: | ----------: |
| 2024-01 | 298764720.0 | 298764720.0 |
| 2024-02 | 413105149.0 | 711869869.0 |
| 2024-03 | 527614956.0 | 1239484825.0 |
| 2024-04 | 463645381.0 | 1703130206.0 |
| 2024-05 | 444935778.0 | 2148065984.0 |
| 2024-06 | 373863202.0 | 2521929186.0 |
| 2024-07 | 360080397.0 | 2882009583.0 |
| 2024-08 | 407562440.0 | 3289572023.0 |
| ... | ... | ... |

## LAG and LEAD — Referencing Adjacent Rows

`LAG(col, n)` references `n` rows before, and `LEAD(col, n)` references `n` rows after. You can also specify a default value when the referenced row does not exist.

```sql
-- Month-over-month revenue growth rate (MoM) for 2024
SELECT
    year_month,
    monthly_revenue,
    LAG(monthly_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY year_month) AS prev_month_revenue,
    ROUND(
        100.0 * (monthly_revenue - LAG(monthly_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY year_month))
              / LAG(monthly_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY year_month),
        1
    ) AS mom_growth_pct
FROM (
    SELECT
        SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 7) AS year_month,
        SUM(total_amount)        AS monthly_revenue
    FROM orders
    WHERE ordered_at LIKE '2024%'
      AND status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'returned')
    GROUP BY SUBSTR(ordered_at, 1, 7)
) AS monthly
ORDER BY year_month;
```

**Result (example):**

| year_month | monthly_revenue | prev_month_revenue | mom_growth_pct |
| ---------- | ----------: | ---------- | ---------- |
| 2024-01 | 298764720.0 | (NULL) | (NULL) |
| 2024-02 | 413105149.0 | 298764720.0 | 38.3 |
| 2024-03 | 527614956.0 | 413105149.0 | 27.7 |
| 2024-04 | 463645381.0 | 527614956.0 | -12.1 |
| 2024-05 | 444935778.0 | 463645381.0 | -4.0 |
| 2024-06 | 373863202.0 | 444935778.0 | -16.0 |
| 2024-07 | 360080397.0 | 373863202.0 | -3.7 |
| 2024-08 | 407562440.0 | 360080397.0 | 13.2 |

## Using PARTITION BY with LEAD

=== "SQLite"
    ```sql
    -- VIP customers: order list with days until next order
    SELECT
        c.name          AS customer_name,
        o.order_number,
        o.ordered_at,
        LEAD(o.ordered_at) OVER (
            PARTITION BY o.customer_id
            ORDER BY o.ordered_at
        ) AS next_order_date,
        ROUND(
            julianday(
                LEAD(o.ordered_at) OVER (PARTITION BY o.customer_id ORDER BY o.ordered_at)
            ) - julianday(o.ordered_at),
            0
        ) AS days_to_next_order
    FROM orders AS o
    INNER JOIN customers AS c ON o.customer_id = c.id
    WHERE c.grade = 'VIP'
    ORDER BY c.name, o.ordered_at
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

=== "MySQL"
    ```sql
    -- VIP customers: order list with days until next order
    SELECT
        c.name          AS customer_name,
        o.order_number,
        o.ordered_at,
        LEAD(o.ordered_at) OVER (
            PARTITION BY o.customer_id
            ORDER BY o.ordered_at
        ) AS next_order_date,
        DATEDIFF(
            LEAD(o.ordered_at) OVER (PARTITION BY o.customer_id ORDER BY o.ordered_at),
            o.ordered_at
        ) AS days_to_next_order
    FROM orders AS o
    INNER JOIN customers AS c ON o.customer_id = c.id
    WHERE c.grade = 'VIP'
    ORDER BY c.name, o.ordered_at
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

=== "PostgreSQL"
    ```sql
    -- VIP customers: order list with days until next order
    SELECT
        c.name          AS customer_name,
        o.order_number,
        o.ordered_at,
        LEAD(o.ordered_at) OVER (
            PARTITION BY o.customer_id
            ORDER BY o.ordered_at
        ) AS next_order_date,
        LEAD(o.ordered_at) OVER (PARTITION BY o.customer_id ORDER BY o.ordered_at)::date
            - o.ordered_at::date
            AS days_to_next_order
    FROM orders AS o
    INNER JOIN customers AS c ON o.customer_id = c.id
    WHERE c.grade = 'VIP'
    ORDER BY c.name, o.ordered_at
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

## Additional Window Function Applications

### Point Balance Verification (SUM OVER)

Verify whether `balance_after` in `point_transactions` is correct using `SUM() OVER()`.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    customer_id,
    type,
    reason,
    amount,
    balance_after,
    SUM(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY created_at, id
    ) AS calculated_balance,
    balance_after - SUM(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY created_at, id
    ) AS difference
FROM point_transactions
WHERE customer_id = 42
ORDER BY created_at, id;
```

### Grade Change Tracking (LAG)

Track changes between previous and current grades in `customer_grade_history`.

```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    changed_at,
    old_grade,
    new_grade,
    reason,
    LAG(new_grade) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY changed_at
    ) AS previous_record_grade,
    LEAD(changed_at) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY changed_at
    ) AS next_change_date
FROM customer_grade_history
WHERE customer_id = 42
ORDER BY changed_at;
```

## FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE — First/Last Value in a Partition

`FIRST_VALUE(col)` retrieves the value from the first row of the window frame, and `LAST_VALUE(col)` retrieves the value from the last row.

| Function | Description |
|------|------|
| `FIRST_VALUE(col) OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)` | First row value in the frame |
| `LAST_VALUE(col) OVER (... ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)` | Last row value in the frame |

!!! warning "The LAST_VALUE Frame Trap"
    The default window frame is `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`. With this default frame, `LAST_VALUE` always returns the value of the **current row**, so to get the actual last value of the partition, you must explicitly specify `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`.

```sql
-- Show the cheapest product (FIRST_VALUE) and
-- most expensive product (LAST_VALUE) per category
SELECT
    cat.name  AS category,
    p.name    AS product_name,
    p.price,
    FIRST_VALUE(p.name) OVER (
        PARTITION BY p.category_id
        ORDER BY p.price
    ) AS cheapest_product,
    LAST_VALUE(p.name) OVER (
        PARTITION BY p.category_id
        ORDER BY p.price
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) AS most_expensive_product
FROM products AS p
INNER JOIN categories AS cat ON p.category_id = cat.id
WHERE p.is_active = 1
ORDER BY cat.name, p.price
LIMIT 12;
```

`FIRST_VALUE` always returns the first row of the partition (the cheapest product) even with the default frame under `ORDER BY p.price`. In contrast, `LAST_VALUE` returns the value of the current row itself if `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` is not specified, so be careful.

**Common real-world scenarios for window functions:**

- **Revenue ranking:** Top-N by category/region (ROW_NUMBER, RANK)
- **Trend analysis:** Month-over-month growth, year-over-year comparison (LAG, LEAD)
- **Cumulative metrics:** Daily cumulative revenue, cumulative user count (SUM OVER)
- **Segment analysis:** Customer revenue quartiles, score percentiles (NTILE)
- **Moving averages:** 7-day/30-day moving averages for trend detection (ROWS BETWEEN)

## Summary

| Function / Syntax | Use Case |
|-------------|------|
| `ROW_NUMBER()` | Unique sequence number within partition |
| `RANK()` / `DENSE_RANK()` | Ranking with ties (with/without gaps) |
| `SUM() OVER (ORDER BY ...)` | Running total |
| `LAG(col, n)` / `LEAD(col, n)` | Reference previous/next row |
| `NTILE(n)` | Divide into n equal groups |
| `FIRST_VALUE(col)` | First row value in frame |
| `LAST_VALUE(col)` | Last row value in frame (frame specification required) |
| `ROWS BETWEEN ... AND ...` | Window frame range specification |

### Problem 4
Use `ROW_NUMBER()` to number each customer's orders and extract only the first order. Return `customer_id`, `name`, `order_number`, `ordered_at`, `total_amount`.

??? success "Answer"

        INNER JOIN customers AS c ON o.customer_id = c.id
        WHERE o.status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'returned')
    ) AS numbered
    WHERE rn = 1
    ORDER BY ordered_at
    LIMIT 15;
