# Lesson 21: SELF JOIN and CROSS JOIN

In [Lessons 8-9](../intermediate/08-inner-join.md), we connected different tables using INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN. Now we will learn two special JOINs. SELF JOIN connects a table to itself (manager-employee relationships), and CROSS JOIN creates all combinations (dates x categories).

!!! note "Already familiar?"
    If you are comfortable with SELF JOIN and CROSS JOIN, skip ahead to [Lesson 22: Views](22-views.md).

    CEO["CEO\n(manager_id = NULL)"] --> MGR1["Manager A\nSales"]

    MGR1 --> S1["Staff 1"]
    MGR1 --> S2["Staff 2"]
    MGR2 --> S3["Staff 3"]
```

> A Self-JOIN joins a table to itself. The manager_id in the staff table can represent an organization chart.

**Common real-world scenarios for SELF JOIN and CROSS JOIN:**

- **Hierarchical relationships:** Manager-employee, category parent-child (SELF JOIN)
- **Pair comparison:** Analyzing product/customer pairs under same conditions (SELF JOIN + id < id)
- **Complete matrix:** Month x category, grade x payment method reports with no gaps (CROSS JOIN)
- **Ratio calculation:** Attach grand total to every row via CROSS JOIN for % calculation

## SELF JOIN — Joining a Table to Itself

SELF JOIN is not special syntax. Simply JOIN the same table with different aliases.

### Querying Category Hierarchy

The `categories` table references itself via `parent_id`. A SELF JOIN can expand the parent-child relationship.

```sql
-- 카테고리의 부모-자식 관계 조회
SELECT
    child.id,
    child.name       AS category,
    child.depth,
    parent.name      AS parent_category
FROM categories AS child
LEFT JOIN categories AS parent ON child.parent_id = parent.id
ORDER BY child.depth, child.sort_order;
```

**Result (example):**

| id | category | depth | parent_category |
| ----------: | ---------- | ----------: | ---------- |
| 1 | Desktop PC | 0 | (NULL) |
| 5 | Laptop | 0 | (NULL) |
| 10 | Monitor | 0 | (NULL) |
| 14 | CPU | 0 | (NULL) |
| 17 | Motherboard | 0 | (NULL) |
| 20 | Memory (RAM) | 0 | (NULL) |
| 23 | Storage | 0 | (NULL) |
| 27 | Graphics Card | 0 | (NULL) |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Top-level categories (`depth=0`) have NULL `parent_id`, so `parent_category` is also NULL. `LEFT JOIN` is used to include these rows in the results.

### Building Top-Sub Category Paths

A SELF JOIN can build the full path from parent (top category) to child (sub category).

=== "SQLite / PostgreSQL"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        parent.name AS top_category,
        child.name  AS sub_category,
        parent.name || ' > ' || child.name AS full_path
    FROM categories AS child
    INNER JOIN categories AS parent ON child.parent_id = parent.id
    WHERE child.depth = 1
    ORDER BY parent.sort_order, child.sort_order;
    ```

=== "MySQL"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        parent.name AS top_category,
        child.name  AS sub_category,
        CONCAT(parent.name, ' > ', child.name) AS full_path
    FROM categories AS child
    INNER JOIN categories AS parent ON child.parent_id = parent.id
    WHERE child.depth = 1
    ORDER BY parent.sort_order, child.sort_order;
    ```

**Result (example):**

| top_category | sub_category | full_path |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| 데스크톱 PC | 완제품 | 데스크톱 PC > 완제품 |
| 데스크톱 PC | 조립PC | 데스크톱 PC > 조립PC |
| 노트북 | 일반 노트북 | 노트북 > 일반 노트북 |
| 노트북 | 게이밍 노트북 | 노트북 > 게이밍 노트북 |
| ... | | |

> **Tip:** SELF JOIN is concise when the hierarchy depth is fixed. For variable depth, use recursive CTEs from Lesson 19.

### Comparing Products Within the Same Category

To compare prices between products in the same category, JOIN the `products` table to itself.

```sql
-- 같은 카테고리에서 가격 차이가 가장 큰 상품 쌍 찾기
SELECT
    p1.name AS product_a,
    p2.name AS product_b,
    p1.price AS price_a,
    p2.price AS price_b,
    ABS(p1.price - p2.price) AS price_diff
FROM products AS p1
INNER JOIN products AS p2
    ON p1.category_id = p2.category_id
   AND p1.id < p2.id  -- 중복 쌍 방지 (A-B만, B-A는 제외)
ORDER BY price_diff DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

The `p1.id < p2.id` condition is key. Without it, both (A, B) and (B, A) would appear, and (A, A) self-pairs would be included.

### Employee Organization Chart (staff.manager_id)

The `staff` table's `manager_id` references `id` in the same table. You can query the employee-manager relationship.

```sql
SELECT
    s.name AS employee,
    s.department,
    s.role,
    m.name AS manager
FROM staff s
LEFT JOIN staff m ON s.manager_id = m.id
ORDER BY s.id;
```

### Product Succession (products.successor_id)

Query discontinued products and their successor models.

```sql
SELECT
    old.name AS discontinued_product,
    old.discontinued_at,
    new.name AS successor_product,
    new.price AS new_price
FROM products old
JOIN products new ON old.successor_id = new.id
WHERE old.successor_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY old.discontinued_at;
```

### Product Q&A Thread (product_qna.parent_id)

Display questions and answers on a single row.

```sql
SELECT
    q.id AS question_id,
    q.content AS question,
    a.content AS answer,
    a.created_at AS answered_at
FROM product_qna q
LEFT JOIN product_qna a ON a.parent_id = q.id
WHERE q.parent_id IS NULL  -- top-level questions only
ORDER BY q.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## CROSS JOIN — Generating All Combinations

![CROSS JOIN Grid](../img/cross-join-grid.svg){ .off-glb width="440"  }

`CROSS JOIN` combines every row from the left table with every row from the right table. Result rows = left rows x right rows. There is no ON condition.

### Month-Category Matrix

When a revenue report needs to show "months with no data," first create an empty frame with CROSS JOIN, then LEFT JOIN actual data.

=== "SQLite"
    ```sql
    -- 2024 12 months x top-level category matrix
    WITH months AS (
        SELECT '2024-01' AS m UNION ALL SELECT '2024-02'

    ),
    top_categories AS (
        SELECT id, name FROM categories WHERE depth = 0
    ),
    monthly_sales AS (
        SELECT
            SUBSTR(o.ordered_at, 1, 7) AS year_month,
            COALESCE(parent.id, cat.id) AS category_id,
            ROUND(SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price), 2) AS revenue
        FROM order_items AS oi
        INNER JOIN orders     AS o      ON oi.order_id   = o.id
        INNER JOIN products   AS p      ON oi.product_id = p.id
        INNER JOIN categories AS cat    ON p.category_id = cat.id
        LEFT  JOIN categories AS parent ON cat.parent_id = parent.id
        WHERE o.ordered_at LIKE '2024%'
          AND o.status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'returned', 'return_requested')
        GROUP BY SUBSTR(o.ordered_at, 1, 7), COALESCE(parent.id, cat.id)
    )
    SELECT
        m.m AS year_month,
        tc.name AS category,
        COALESCE(ms.revenue, 0) AS revenue
    FROM months AS m
    CROSS JOIN top_categories AS tc
    LEFT JOIN monthly_sales AS ms
        ON m.m = ms.year_month AND tc.id = ms.category_id
    ORDER BY m.m, tc.name;
    ```

=== "MySQL"

        INNER JOIN orders     AS o      ON oi.order_id   = o.id
        INNER JOIN products   AS p      ON oi.product_id = p.id
        INNER JOIN categories AS cat    ON p.category_id = cat.id
        LEFT  JOIN categories AS parent ON cat.parent_id = parent.id
        WHERE o.ordered_at >= '2024-01-01'
          AND o.ordered_at <  '2025-01-01'
          AND o.status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'returned', 'return_requested')
        GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(o.ordered_at, '%Y-%m'), COALESCE(parent.id, cat.id)
    )
    SELECT
        m.m AS year_month,
        tc.name AS category,
        COALESCE(ms.revenue, 0) AS revenue
    FROM months AS m
    CROSS JOIN top_categories AS tc
    LEFT JOIN monthly_sales AS ms
        ON m.m = ms.year_month AND tc.id = ms.category_id
    ORDER BY m.m, tc.name;
    ```

=== "PostgreSQL"
    ```sql
    WITH months AS (
        SELECT '2024-01' AS m UNION ALL SELECT '2024-02'
        UNION ALL SELECT '2024-03' UNION ALL SELECT '2024-04'
        UNION ALL SELECT '2024-05' UNION ALL SELECT '2024-06'
        UNION ALL SELECT '2024-07' UNION ALL SELECT '2024-08'
        UNION ALL SELECT '2024-09' UNION ALL SELECT '2024-10'
        UNION ALL SELECT '2024-11' UNION ALL SELECT '2024-12'
    ),
    top_categories AS (
        SELECT id, name FROM categories WHERE depth = 0
    ),
    monthly_sales AS (
        SELECT
            TO_CHAR(o.ordered_at, 'YYYY-MM') AS year_month,
            COALESCE(parent.id, cat.id) AS category_id,
            ROUND(SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price), 2) AS revenue
        FROM order_items AS oi
        INNER JOIN orders     AS o      ON oi.order_id   = o.id
        INNER JOIN products   AS p      ON oi.product_id = p.id
        INNER JOIN categories AS cat    ON p.category_id = cat.id
        LEFT  JOIN categories AS parent ON cat.parent_id = parent.id
        WHERE o.ordered_at >= '2024-01-01'
          AND o.ordered_at <  '2025-01-01'
          AND o.status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'returned', 'return_requested')
        GROUP BY TO_CHAR(o.ordered_at, 'YYYY-MM'), COALESCE(parent.id, cat.id)
    )
    SELECT
        m.m AS year_month,
        tc.name AS category,
        COALESCE(ms.revenue, 0) AS revenue
    FROM months AS m
    CROSS JOIN top_categories AS tc
    LEFT JOIN monthly_sales AS ms
        ON m.m = ms.year_month AND tc.id = ms.category_id
    ORDER BY m.m, tc.name;
    ```

After creating a complete matrix of 12 x N rows with CROSS JOIN, LEFT JOIN attaches actual revenue. Cells with no revenue become 0 via `COALESCE`.

### Calculating Ratios Against Total Revenue

Another CROSS JOIN use case: attach the grand total to every row for ratio calculation.

```sql
-- 각 결제 수단이 전체 매출에서 차지하는 비율
SELECT
    p.method,
    COUNT(*)              AS tx_count,
    ROUND(SUM(p.amount), 2) AS total_amount,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(p.amount) / gt.grand_total, 1) AS pct
FROM payments AS p
CROSS JOIN (
    SELECT SUM(amount) AS grand_total
    FROM payments
    WHERE status = 'completed'
) AS gt
WHERE p.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY p.method, gt.grand_total
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;
```

> **Warning:** CROSS JOIN is powerful, but CROSS JOINing large tables causes row explosion. Only use it when one or both sides are small result sets.

### Finding Days with No Orders (calendar CROSS JOIN)

Find days with no orders using the `calendar` table with CROSS JOIN + LEFT JOIN.

```sql
SELECT
    c.date_key,
    c.day_name,
    c.is_weekend,
    c.is_holiday,
    c.holiday_name
FROM calendar c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON DATE(o.ordered_at) = c.date_key
WHERE o.id IS NULL
  AND c.year >= 2024
ORDER BY c.date_key;
```

### Problem 6: Ratio Calculation with CROSS JOIN

Calculate the percentage (%) each customer grade represents of total active customers. Use CROSS JOIN to attach the total count for calculation. Round to one decimal place.

??? success "Answer"
    ```sql
    SELECT
        grade,
        COUNT(*)  AS grade_count,
        ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / gt.total, 1) AS pct
    FROM customers
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS total
        FROM customers
        WHERE is_active = 1
    ) AS gt
    WHERE is_active = 1
    GROUP BY grade, gt.total
    ORDER BY pct DESC;
    ```

    **Result (example):**

| grade | grade_count | pct |
| ---------- | ----------: | ----------: |
| BRONZE | 2289 | 62.5 |
| GOLD | 524 | 14.3 |
| SILVER | 479 | 13.1 |
| VIP | 368 | 10.1 |


### Problem 7: Quarter-Payment Method CROSS JOIN Report

Generate all combinations of 4 quarters (`Q1`-`Q4`) and payment methods (`DISTINCT method`) for 2024 using CROSS JOIN, and LEFT JOIN to get the total payment amount for each combination. Display 0 for cells with no payments.

??? success "Answer"
