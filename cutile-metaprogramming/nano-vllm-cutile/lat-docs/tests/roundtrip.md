# Roundtrip

Parse → render fidelity test for the [[parser]]. The fixture `tests/roundtrip.md` exercises every supported markdown and wiki link feature. The test reads it, runs `parse()` → `toMarkdown()`, and asserts the output is identical to the input.

Must be updated whenever the wiki link syntax or markdown rendering changes. If a new syntactic feature is added, add it to the fixture. If the roundtrip breaks, the parser or renderer lost fidelity.

## Covered features

The roundtrip fixture exercises all supported markdown and wiki link syntax features.

Headings (all 6 levels), paragraphs, emphasis, strong, strong emphasis, inline code, fenced code blocks (with and without language), links (inline and reference-style), images (standalone and inline), blockquotes (including nested), ordered and unordered lists (including nested and mixed), thematic breaks, hard line breaks, escaped characters, and every wiki link variation: `[[file]]`, `[[file#Heading]]`, `[[file#H1#H2]]`, `[[path/file#H1#H2]]`, each with and without aliases.
