# Check Index

Tests for validating `lat.md/` directory index files and subdirectory index files.

## Detects missing index file

Given a `lat.md/` directory with files but no index file (`lat.md`), `checkIndex` reports a missing-index error and includes a bullet-list snippet covering all visible entries.

## Passes with valid index

Given a `lat.md/` directory whose index file lists all visible entries with descriptions, `checkIndex` returns no errors.

## Detects stale index entry

Given an index file that lists a file which does not exist on disk, `checkIndex` reports it as a stale entry.

## Detects missing subdirectory index file

Given a `lat.md/` directory with a subdirectory containing files but no index file for that subdirectory, `checkIndex` reports a missing-index error with a snippet listing the subdirectory's entries.

## Passes with valid subdirectory index

Given a `lat.md/` directory where both the root and a subdirectory have correct index files listing all visible entries, `checkIndex` returns no errors.

## Detects stale subdirectory index entry

Given a subdirectory index file that lists a file which does not exist on disk, `checkIndex` reports it as a stale entry.

## Detects non-markdown file

Given a `lat.md/` directory containing a file without a `.md` extension (e.g. `README`), `checkIndex` reports it as an error since only markdown files belong in `lat.md/`.

## Non-markdown files excluded from index listing

Non-`.md` files do not appear in missing-entry suggestions or index snippets — only markdown files participate in index validation.
